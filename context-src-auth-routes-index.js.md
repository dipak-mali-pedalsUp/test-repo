This code file serves as the main routing configuration for an Express.js application, likely for a platform that involves creators, brands, and administrators. Its key functionalities include:

1. Centralized Route Management: It imports and configures routes from various modules, organizing them under specific URL paths.

2. Authentication: It includes auth routes, suggesting user authentication functionality.

3. Brand-related Features: Routes for brands, insertion orders, campaigns, partners, partner groups, and analytics are set up.

4. Creator Features: Routes for creator-specific functionality, including my store, creator profiles, brand interactions, and link management.

5. Administrative Functions: Routes for admin users to manage creators, brands, members, orders, and view dashboards.

6. Social Media Integration: A route for social media authentication for creators.

7. Dashboard Access: Separate dashboard routes for both brands and admins.

8. Order Management: Routes for handling orders for both creators and admins.

The file acts as a central hub for routing, directing incoming requests to the appropriate handler functions in other modules. This structure promotes modularity and separation of concerns in the application architecture.
