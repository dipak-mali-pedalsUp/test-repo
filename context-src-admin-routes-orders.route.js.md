This code file defines the routes for handling order-related operations in an admin panel of a backend application. Here's a summary of its purpose and key functionality:

1. Purpose:
   - To set up and manage routes specifically for order-related operations in the admin section of the application.
   - To ensure that only authorized users (admins and super admins) can access these routes.

2. Key Functionality:
   - Imports necessary modules and middlewares, including Express for routing and authentication middleware.
   - Defines three main routes for order management:
     a. GET '/' - Retrieves a list of orders
     b. GET '/analytics' - Fetches order analytics data
     c. GET '/:transaction_id' - Retrieves details of a specific order by its transaction ID
   - Implements role-based access control using the 'auth' middleware, restricting access to users with 'admin' or 'superAdmin' roles.
   - Uses the orderController to handle the logic for each route, separating concerns between routing and business logic.

3. Structure:
   - Utilizes Express Router to create modular, mountable route handlers.
   - Keeps the routes organized and easily maintainable by grouping them in a single file.

This code serves as a crucial part of the application's backend, managing how order data is accessed and processed through the admin interface while ensuring proper authorization.
