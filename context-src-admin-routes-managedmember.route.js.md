This code file defines the routes for managing members in an admin panel of a web application. Its key functionalities include:

1. Setting up an Express router for handling HTTP requests related to managed members.

2. Importing necessary middlewares, validators, and controllers.

3. Defining three main routes:
   a. POST '/' - For adding a new managed member
   b. GET '/' - For retrieving a list of managed members
   c. PUT '/change-member-type' - For changing a member's role or type

4. Implementing authentication middleware to ensure only admin and superAdmin roles can access these routes.

5. Using validation middleware to validate incoming request data for adding members and changing member roles.

6. Employing specific controller functions to handle the business logic for each route.

The purpose of this file is to centralize and organize the routing logic for managing members, ensuring proper authentication, validation, and handling of requests related to member management in the admin section of the application.
