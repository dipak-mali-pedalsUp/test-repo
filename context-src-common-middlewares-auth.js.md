This code defines an authentication middleware for an Express.js application. Its main purpose is to validate and authorize user requests based on their roles and access tokens. Here are the key functionalities:

1. Token Validation: It checks for the presence of an authorization token in the request headers and validates it using a JWT secret.

2. Role-based Access Control: It allows specifying an array of allowed roles for each route. If the user's role is not in this array, access is denied.

3. User Authentication: For different user roles (branduser, creator, admin, superAdmin), it verifies the token using a token service.

4. Request Enrichment: Upon successful authentication, it adds user information and role to the request object for use in subsequent middleware or route handlers.

5. Error Handling: It sends appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for various authentication failures (e.g., missing token, invalid token, unauthorized role).

6. Flexibility: The middleware is designed to be reusable across different routes with varying role requirements.

This middleware serves as a crucial security layer, ensuring that only authenticated users with appropriate roles can access protected routes in the application.
