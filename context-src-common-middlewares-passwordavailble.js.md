This code defines a middleware function called `isPasswordAvailable` for use in an Express.js application. The primary purpose of this middleware is to check if a user has completed their onboarding process by verifying if they have set a password.

Key functionality:

1. The middleware takes an optional parameter `allowedRoleArray` (currently unused in the provided code).

2. It searches for a user in the database based on the email and user_type provided in the request body, ensuring the user is not deleted.

3. If no user is found, it returns a 404 (Not Found) status with an appropriate message.

4. If a user is found and has a password set (not null), the middleware allows the request to proceed to the next handler.

5. If the user is found but doesn't have a password set, it returns a 403 (Forbidden) status, prompting the user to complete the onboarding process by clicking the link in their email.

6. Any errors encountered during this process are logged and result in a 403 (Forbidden) status being sent back to the client.

This middleware is likely used in authentication or user management routes to ensure users have completed their registration process before allowing certain actions.
