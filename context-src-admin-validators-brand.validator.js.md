This code file defines a validation schema for brand-related operations, specifically for sending an invitation link. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and key functionality:

1. Purpose:
   The code establishes validation rules for the email field when sending a create invitation link for a brand.

2. Key Functionality:
   - It exports an object called `brandValidation` containing validation rules.
   - The `sendCreateInvitationLink` property defines the validation for the email field.
   - The email validation includes the following checks:
     a. Trimming whitespace
     b. Ensuring the field is not empty
     c. Verifying that the input is a valid email address
   - An error message is provided if the email validation fails.

3. Usage:
   This validation schema can be used in conjunction with express-validator or a similar validation middleware to ensure that the email input meets the specified criteria before processing the request to send an invitation link.

Overall, this code helps maintain data integrity and improve user experience by validating user input for brand-related operations.
