This code defines validation rules for creating partner groups in a backend system. The main purpose of this file is to ensure data integrity and proper formatting when creating new partner groups.

Key functionality:

1. It exports an object called `partnergroupsValidations` containing validation rules.

2. The object has a `createPartnersGroup` property, which defines validation rules for creating a new partner group.

3. Two fields are validated:
   a. `group_name`: Ensures that a group name is provided and not empty.
   b. `partnerids`: Validates that an array of partner IDs is provided and not empty.

4. Each field has specific validation rules and custom error messages.

5. This validation schema can be used with validation middleware (e.g., express-validator) to enforce these rules when processing requests to create new partner groups.

The code helps maintain data consistency and provides meaningful error messages for invalid input, improving the overall reliability and user experience of the partner group creation process.
