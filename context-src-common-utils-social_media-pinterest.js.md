This code file is part of a backend system for handling Pinterest authentication and data retrieval. Its main purpose is to facilitate the OAuth 2.0 flow for Pinterest and fetch basic user profile information. Here are the key functionalities:

1. It imports necessary dependencies and configuration settings for Pinterest API integration.

2. The main function, `generateData`, performs the following tasks:
   - Exchanges an authorization code for access and refresh tokens using Pinterest's OAuth endpoint.
   - Uses the obtained access token to fetch the user's profile information from Pinterest's API.
   - Returns a structured object containing the access token, refresh token, and key user profile data (ID, username, and profile image URL).

3. The code handles errors that may occur during the API requests and throws them for higher-level error handling.

4. It uses environment variables (accessed through a config object) to store sensitive information like client ID and secret, enhancing security and configurability.

This module is likely part of a larger system that manages social media integrations, specifically handling the Pinterest-related authentication and data retrieval processes.
