This code defines a Mongoose schema and model for tracking user sessions in a MongoDB database. Here's a breakdown of its key functionality:

1. Schema Definition:
   - The schema, named 'sessionSchema', defines the structure for session documents.
   - It includes fields for user_id (referencing the UserCredentials model), sessionStartTime, and sessionEndTime.

2. Fields:
   - user_id: An ObjectId referencing the UserCredentials model, required for each session.
   - sessionStartTime: A required number representing the start time of the session.
   - sessionEndTime: An optional number representing the end time of the session, defaulting to null.

3. Timestamps:
   - The schema uses the 'timestamps' option to automatically add and manage createdAt and updatedAt fields.
   - It uses a custom currentTime function that returns the current time in seconds (Unix timestamp).

4. Model Creation:
   - The Mongoose model 'Session' is created based on the sessionSchema.

5. Export:
   - The Session model is exported for use in other parts of the application.

This model can be used to create, read, update, and delete session records, allowing the application to track user session durations and activities.
