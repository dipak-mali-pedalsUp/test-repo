This code file provides utility functions for working with MongoDB and Mongoose in a Node.js application. Its main purposes and key functionalities are:

1. ObjectId Handling:
   - The `createObjectId` function creates a valid MongoDB ObjectId. It can either generate a new ObjectId or create one from a provided hexadecimal string. It also includes error handling for invalid input.
   - The `isValidObjectId` function checks if a given id is a valid MongoDB ObjectId.

2. MongoDB Session Management:
   - The `mongoSession` function is an asynchronous helper that starts a new MongoDB session using Mongoose.

These utilities are designed to simplify common tasks when working with MongoDB ObjectIds and sessions in a Mongoose-based application. They provide a layer of abstraction and error handling, making it easier to work with MongoDB-specific concepts in the broader application context.
