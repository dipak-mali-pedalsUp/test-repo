This code defines a Mongoose schema and model for a "GroupsMaster" collection in a MongoDB database. The purpose of this model is to represent and manage groups within a brand management system. Here are the key functionalities:

1. Schema Definition:
   - Defines a structure for group documents with fields like group_name, brand_id, is_deleted, createdAt, and updatedAt.
   - The group_name is a required string field.
   - The brand_id is a required field that references the brand model, establishing a relationship between groups and brands.
   - The is_deleted field is a boolean with a default value of false, likely used for soft deletion.

2. Timestamps:
   - Automatically manages createdAt and updatedAt fields, storing them as Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch).

3. Referencing:
   - Creates a relationship with the brand model using the brand_id field, allowing for data associations between groups and brands.

4. Model Creation:
   - Creates a Mongoose model named "groupsmaster" based on the defined schema, which can be used to interact with the corresponding MongoDB collection.

This model can be used to create, read, update, and delete group records, as well as to establish relationships between groups and brands in the application.
