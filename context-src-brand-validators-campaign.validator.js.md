This code file defines a set of validation rules for a campaign-related functionality in a backend application. The main purpose of this code is to ensure that all required fields are properly filled out when creating, deleting, or pausing/unpausing a campaign.

Key functionality includes:

1. Create validation: Ensures all necessary fields for creating a campaign are provided and not empty, including campaign name, tagline, key objective, description, cover photo, start date/time, pricing strategy details, insertion order, product links, and partner list.

2. Delete validation: Checks that at least one campaign is selected for deletion.

3. Pause/Unpause validation: Verifies that at least one campaign is selected for pausing or unpausing.

The validation rules use a combination of 'notEmpty' checks and custom validation functions to ensure data integrity. Error messages are provided for each field to guide users in case of validation failures.

This validator file is likely used in conjunction with a validation middleware to check incoming requests before processing them in the main application logic, helping to maintain data quality and prevent errors caused by missing or invalid data.
