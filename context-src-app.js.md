This code file (app.js) serves as the main entry point for an Express.js backend application. Its primary purposes and key functionalities include:

1. Setting up the Express application:
   - Initializes an Express app
   - Configures middleware (cors, json parsing, and URL-encoded data parsing)

2. Database connection:
   - Establishes a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose
   - Logs the connection status

3. Routing:
   - Imports and uses routes from a separate file
   - Sets up the base route ("/") for the API

4. Server initialization:
   - Starts the server using a custom startServer function

5. Error handling and logging:
   - Uses http-status for generating status codes
   - Implements logging using a custom logger

6. Configuration management:
   - Imports configuration settings from a separate file

Overall, this file acts as the central point for setting up the backend application, connecting to the database, and initializing the server. It provides a structured approach to building a Node.js backend with Express, MongoDB, and various middleware components.
