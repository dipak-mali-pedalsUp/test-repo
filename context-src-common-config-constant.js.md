This code defines and exports a frozen object containing environment constants for a Node.js application. The purpose of this file is to provide a centralized location for defining environment-specific constants that can be used throughout the application.

Key functionality:

1. It defines three environment constants:
   - STAGING_DEV_ENV: Represents the staging environment
   - LOCAL_DEV_ENV: Represents the local development environment
   - PROD_DEV_ENV: Represents the production environment

2. The object is frozen using Object.freeze(), which prevents the constants from being modified elsewhere in the application, ensuring consistency and preventing accidental changes.

3. The constants are exported as a module, allowing them to be imported and used in other parts of the application.

This approach helps maintain a clear separation of environment-specific configurations and allows for easy switching between different environments during development, testing, and deployment processes.
