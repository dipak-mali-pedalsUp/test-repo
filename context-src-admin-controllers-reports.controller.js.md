This code file is a controller for generating reports in an administrative backend system. Its main purpose and key functionalities include:

1. Handling report generation requests, specifically for transaction reports.

2. Utilizing various models (Brand, Partner, Campaign, Transaction, TransactionOrder) to fetch and aggregate data.

3. Implementing a `getReports` function that processes incoming requests for report generation.

4. Containing a `generateTransactionReport` function that performs complex data aggregation using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline.

5. Transforming raw data into a more user-friendly format, including calculations for commissions and formatting of dates.

6. Preparing data for potential CSV export (though this functionality is currently commented out).

7. Implementing error handling and logging for both the main controller function and the report generation process.

8. Utilizing date range filtering for report generation based on start and end dates provided in the request.

9. Joining data from multiple collections to create a comprehensive transaction report including brand, creator, campaign, and order details.

10. Returning the processed data as a JSON response, with appropriate HTTP status codes for successful and failed requests.

This controller serves as a crucial component for generating detailed transaction reports, likely for administrative or analytical purposes within the application.
