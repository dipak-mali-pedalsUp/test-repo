This code file defines a validation schema for managing members in an admin context. The main purposes and key functionalities are:

1. It exports an object called `addManagedMemberValidator` containing two validation schemas:

   a. `addMember`: Validates input when adding a new managed member
      - Ensures the email is provided, trimmed, and in a valid format
      - Requires a user_type to be specified

   b. `changeMemberRole`: Validates input when changing a member's role
      - Requires a user_id to be provided
      - Requires a user_type to be specified

2. Each field in the validation schemas includes:
   - Validation rules (e.g., `notEmpty`, `isEmail`)
   - An error message to display if validation fails

3. This validator can be used in conjunction with express-validator or a similar validation middleware to ensure that incoming requests for adding members or changing member roles contain the required information in the correct format.

4. By centralizing these validation rules, the code promotes consistency and reusability across the application when dealing with managed member operations.
