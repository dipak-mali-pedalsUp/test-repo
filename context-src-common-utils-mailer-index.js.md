This code file implements an email sending utility using the Node.js 'nodemailer' package. Its main purpose is to provide a reusable function for sending emails within the application. Here are the key functionalities:

1. It creates a mail transporter using the 'nodemailer' package, configured with email service credentials from a config file.

2. The 'createMailTransporter' function sets up the transporter with the specified email service and authentication details.

3. The main exported function 'sendEmail' takes mail options as an argument and returns a Promise.

4. It uses the created transporter to send the email asynchronously.

5. The code includes error handling and logging for both transporter creation and email sending processes.

6. It uses a logger utility to log success and error messages, enhancing debugging and monitoring capabilities.

7. The function resolves the Promise with 'true' on successful email sending and rejects with 'false' or the error object on failure.

This utility allows other parts of the application to easily send emails by calling the 'sendEmail' function with the appropriate mail options.
