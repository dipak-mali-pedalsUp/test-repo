This code defines a Mongoose schema and model for storing technical details related to brands in a MongoDB database. The key functionalities and purposes of this code are:

1. It creates a schema called `brandtechSchema` for brand technical details, which includes fields such as:
   - brand_id: A reference to the associated brand
   - plateform: The platform used by the brand
   - store_base_url: The base URL of the brand's store
   - endpoints: An object to store various API endpoints
   - secrets: An object to store sensitive information
   - is_deleted: A flag to mark if the record is deleted
   - createdAt and updatedAt: Timestamps for record creation and modification

2. The schema uses the `timestamps` option to automatically update the `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields with Unix timestamps.

3. It establishes a relationship between this schema and the Brand model using the `brand_id` field.

4. The code creates a Mongoose model called `BrandTechnicalDetail` based on the defined schema.

5. This model can be used to perform CRUD operations on brand technical details in the MongoDB database.

6. The purpose of this model is to store and manage technical information related to brands, which may be used for integration with various platforms, API communications, and other technical aspects of brand management in the application.
