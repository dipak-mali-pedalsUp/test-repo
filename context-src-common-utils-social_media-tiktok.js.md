This code file contains utility functions for interacting with the TikTok API. Its main purpose is to facilitate authentication and data retrieval from TikTok for a backend application. The key functionalities include:

1. Authentication:
   - Generating access tokens using an authorization code
   - Refreshing access tokens using a refresh token

2. User Information:
   - Fetching basic user details such as profile ID, image, and handle

3. Video Management:
   - Retrieving a list of videos for a user
   - Fetching detailed information about specific videos

The code uses axios for making HTTP requests to the TikTok API endpoints and handles error logging. It also utilizes environment configuration for API versions and credentials. The functions are designed to be asynchronous and return Promises, making them suitable for use in an asynchronous JavaScript environment.

Overall, this module serves as a bridge between the application and TikTok's API, abstracting the complexities of authentication and data retrieval for TikTok-related features.
