This code defines a Mongoose schema and model for a "Category" in a MongoDB database. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and key functionality:

1. Schema Definition:
   - The code creates a mongoose schema called `categorySchema`.
   - It defines the structure and properties of a category document.

2. Fields:
   - name: A String field to store the category name.
   - is_deleted: A Boolean field to indicate if the category has been deleted (soft delete).
   - createdAt and updatedAt: Number fields to store timestamps.

3. Timestamps:
   - The schema uses the `timestamps` option to automatically manage creation and update times.
   - It uses a custom timestamp function that stores time as Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch).

4. Model Creation:
   - The code creates a Mongoose model named "Category" based on the defined schema.
   - This model can be used to interact with the "category" collection in the MongoDB database.

5. Export:
   - The Category model is exported, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

This code provides a structured way to create, read, update, and delete category documents in the database, ensuring consistency in the data structure and automatic timestamp management.
