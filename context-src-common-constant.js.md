This code file, `constant.js`, serves as a central repository for defining and exporting various constants and enumeration-like objects used throughout the Impression backend application. Its primary purpose is to maintain consistency and provide a single source of truth for different status types, categories, and configurations across the system.

Key functionalities and components include:

1. Insertion Order Types and Statuses: Defines types and statuses for insertion orders, which likely relate to advertising or campaign management.

2. Campaign-related Constants: Includes statuses, pricing strategies, and budget cap types for campaigns.

3. Partner Request Status Types: Defines different states for partner requests.

4. Social Media Platforms: Lists supported social media platforms.

5. Brand Platforms: Specifies e-commerce platforms used by brands.

6. Order Statuses: Defines possible states for orders.

7. User Types: Categorizes users into Brand, Creator, Admin, and SuperAdmin.

8. Report and Invoice Types: Specifies different types of reports and invoices.

9. Transaction Types: Defines transaction states like Returned and Placed.

10. User Categories: Distinguishes between Brand and Creator user types.

By centralizing these constants, the code promotes maintainability and reduces the risk of inconsistencies across the application. It allows developers to easily reference and use these predefined values throughout the codebase, ensuring uniformity in handling various statuses, types, and categories related to the application's functionality.
