This code file implements a custom logging system using the Winston library for a Node.js application. Its main purpose is to create structured, level-specific logs that are automatically rotated and archived. Here are the key functionalities:

1. It creates separate transports for different log levels (error, info, debug, and a combined log) using Winston's DailyRotateFile transport.

2. Each transport is configured to:
   - Write logs to specific files based on the log level
   - Rotate logs daily
   - Compress old log files
   - Keep logs for up to 7 days

3. Three loggers are created (info, error, and debug) with their respective transports and a combined transport.

4. The loggers use a timestamp and JSON format for consistent and easily parseable log entries.

5. A 'logger' object is exported with methods for info, error, and debug logging, which can be easily imported and used throughout the application.

6. There's a commented-out section that suggests console logging could be added for non-production environments, but it's currently disabled.

This setup allows for efficient log management, making it easier to track and analyze application behavior, errors, and debug information in a production environment.
