This code file implements a cron job to automatically update the status of campaigns in a backend system. Here's a summary of its key functionality:

1. Purpose: To periodically check and update the status of campaigns based on their start and end times.

2. Main function: updateCampaignStatus()
   - Sets up a cron job that runs every minute using node-cron.
   - Retrieves all campaigns that are not in 'draft' or 'completed' status.
   - For each campaign:
     a. If the current time is past the start time and the campaign is not paused, it updates the status to 'live'.
     b. If the current time is past the end time, it updates the status to 'completed'.

3. Error handling: Catches and logs any errors that occur during the cron job execution.

4. Dependencies: 
   - Utilizes a custom logger for logging information and errors.
   - Uses the CampaignModel to interact with the database.
   - Imports CampaignStatus from a constants file for status values.

This code ensures that campaign statuses are automatically updated based on their scheduled times, without requiring manual intervention.
