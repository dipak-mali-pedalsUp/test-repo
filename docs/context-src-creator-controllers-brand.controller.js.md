# httpStatus /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:07:37

The `httpStatus` in the code snippet is a reference to the `http-status` npm package, which provides a collection of HTTP status codes and their corresponding messages. It allows developers to use descriptive constants instead of numeric status codes, making the code more readable and maintainable. Here's a brief example of how it might be used:

```javascript
const httpStatus = require('http-status');

res.status(httpStatus.OK).json({ message: 'Success' });
res.status(httpStatus.NOT_FOUND).json({ error: 'Resource not found' });
```

In this example, `httpStatus.OK` represents 200, and `httpStatus.NOT_FOUND` represents 404.

### Use of method

The `httpStatus` import in the given code snippet is not a function or a class. It's a module import statement.

The `http-status` is an npm package that provides a list of HTTP status codes and their corresponding messages. Its purpose is to make it easier to work with HTTP status codes in Node.js applications.

By importing this module, the code gains access to a set of constants representing various HTTP status codes. This allows developers to use these constants instead of hardcoding numeric status codes, which improves code readability and maintainability.

For example, instead of writing:

```javascript
res.status(200).send('OK');
```

You can write:

```javascript
res.status(httpStatus.OK).send('OK');
```

This makes the code more semantic and less error-prone, as you're using named constants instead of magic numbers.

The `http-status` module provides constants for all standard HTTP status codes, such as:

- `httpStatus.OK` (200)
- `httpStatus.CREATED` (201)
- `httpStatus.BAD_REQUEST` (400)
- `httpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED` (401)
- `httpStatus.NOT_FOUND` (404)
- `httpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (500)

And many more.

In the context of a controller file (brand.controller.js), this import is likely used to set appropriate HTTP status codes in the responses sent back to the client when handling various API endpoints related to brand operations.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const httpStatus = require("http-status");
```

This line of code is not defining a function or a class. It's importing a module called "http-status" using Node.js's `require` function and assigning it to a constant variable named `httpStatus`.

The `http-status` is likely a third-party npm package that provides HTTP status codes as constants. It doesn't take any parameters when being imported.

To use it, you would typically access the status codes as properties of the `httpStatus` object. For example:

```javascript
console.log(httpStatus.OK); // Might output 200
console.log(httpStatus.NOT_FOUND); // Might output 404
```

If you need information about specific functions or classes within the brand.controller.js file, you would need to provide the relevant code from that file.

### Return

The code snippet you provided doesn't show a complete function or class. It's just importing the `http-status` package and assigning it to the `httpStatus` constant. 

The `http-status` package is a utility library that provides constants for HTTP status codes. It doesn't return anything by itself; instead, it provides a way to reference HTTP status codes in a more readable and maintainable manner.

For example, instead of using numeric status codes directly in your code, you can use constants like:

```javascript
httpStatus.OK              // 200
httpStatus.CREATED         // 201
httpStatus.BAD_REQUEST     // 400
httpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED    // 401
httpStatus.NOT_FOUND       // 404
httpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR // 500
```

These constants would typically be used when setting the status code of an HTTP response in your controller functions. For instance:

```javascript
res.status(httpStatus.OK).json({ message: 'Success' });
```

Without seeing the rest of the controller file or the specific functions within it, I can't provide information about what any particular function or class returns. The `httpStatus` import itself doesn't return anything; it's just making the HTTP status code constants available for use in the rest of the file.

To know what parameters or methods this `logger` might have, we would need to see the contents of the `logger.js` file. Typically, logger modules often provide methods like:

- `logger.info(message)`
- `logger.error(message)`
- `logger.warn(message)`
- `logger.debug(message)`

But the exact interface would depend on how the logger is implemented in the `logger.js` file.

If you need to know the specific parameters or methods available on this `logger`, you would need to examine the `logger.js` file or its documentation.

### Return

The code snippet you provided:

```javascript
const logger = require("../../common/utils/logger");
```

This line is importing a logger module from a specific path in the project structure. It's not a function or class definition itself, but rather it's assigning the imported logger to a constant named `logger`.

Without seeing the actual implementation of the logger module, I can't tell you exactly what it returns. However, typically, a logger module would return an object or instance with various logging methods. Common methods might include:

- `logger.info()`
- `logger.error()`
- `logger.warn()`
- `logger.debug()`

These methods are used to log messages at different severity levels.

The logger itself could be a custom implementation or could be using a popular logging library like Winston or Bunyan.

# config /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:08:42

In this code snippet, `config` is likely a module or object that contains configuration settings for the application. It's being imported from a file located at "../../common/config/config.js" relative to the current file's location. The `config` object probably holds various settings such as database connection details, API keys, or environment-specific variables that are used throughout the application. Here's a simple example of what the config file might look like:

```javascript
// config.js
module.exports = {
  databaseUrl: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key-here',
  port: process.env.PORT || 3000
};
```

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const config = require("../../common/config/config");
```

is not a function or class definition. Instead, it's a statement that imports a configuration module into the current file.

Here's what it does:

1. It uses Node.js's `require` function to import a module.

2. The path `"../../common/config/config"` suggests that there's a file named `config.js` (or `config/index.js`) in a directory structure like this:

   ```
   src/
   ├── common/
   │   └── config/
   │       └── config.js
   └── creator/
       └── controllers/
           └── brand.controller.js
   ```

3. The `config` variable will now contain whatever is exported from the `config.js` file.

The purpose of this line is to make the configuration settings available in the `brand.controller.js` file. This configuration file likely contains various settings, environment variables, or constants that are used throughout the application.

Common uses for such a configuration module include:

- Database connection settings
- API keys
- Environment-specific variables (development, production, testing)
- Feature flags
- Application-wide constants

By importing this configuration, the brand controller can access these settings and use them as needed in its functions.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const config = require("../../common/config/config");
```

This line is not defining a function or a class. Instead, it's using Node.js's `require` function to import a module.

Specifically:

1. It's importing a module located at `../../common/config/config` relative to the current file's location.
2. The imported module is being assigned to a constant variable named `config`.

The `require` function itself takes a string parameter, which is the path to the module being imported.

To directly answer your question: There is no function or class definition shown in this snippet that takes parameters. This line is simply importing a configuration module, likely to use its exported values or functions elsewhere in the file.

If you want to know what parameters any functions within the imported `config` module might take, you'd need to examine the contents of the `../../common/config/config.js` file (or whatever the actual file extension is).

### Return

The code snippet you provided:

```javascript
const config = require("../../common/config/config");
```

This line is importing a configuration module from the specified file path. It's not a function or class definition, but rather a module import statement.

Here's what it does:

1. It uses Node.js's `require` function to import a module.
2. The path `"../../common/config/config"` is relative to the current file's location.
3. The imported module is assigned to the constant variable `config`.

What this `config` variable contains depends on what is exported from the `../../common/config/config.js` file. Typically, a config file might export an object with various configuration settings. For example:

```javascript
// Example of what might be in ../../common/config/config.js
module.exports = {
  databaseURL: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key-here',
  port: 3000,
  // ... other configuration settings
};
```

So, while this line itself doesn't return anything, the `config` variable it creates will contain whatever is exported from the specified configuration file. This could be an object with various properties, a function, or any other JavaScript value, depending on how the config file is set up.

To know exactly what `config` contains, you'd need to look at the contents of the `../../common/config/config.js` file.

# Types /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:09:15

In the code snippet `const { Types } = require("mongoose");`, `Types` is an object provided by the Mongoose library that contains various constructor functions for MongoDB data types. It is commonly used for type casting and working with MongoDB's specific data types, such as ObjectId. Here's a brief example of how it might be used:

```javascript
const { Types } = require("mongoose");

// Creating a new ObjectId
const newId = new Types.ObjectId();

// Converting a string to ObjectId
const objectIdFromString = Types.ObjectId("5f7b1a7b9d3e2a1b1c9d1e1f");

// Checking if a value is a valid ObjectId
const isValidId = Types.ObjectId.isValid("5f7b1a7b9d3e2a1b1c9d1e1f");
```

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const { Types } = require("mongoose");
```

is not a function or class definition. Instead, it's an import statement using object destructuring. Let me explain its purpose:

1. This line is importing the `Types` object from the Mongoose library.

2. Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data.

3. The `Types` object from Mongoose contains various SchemaTypes and their associated utilities. It's commonly used for working with MongoDB ObjectIds and other specific data types.

4. Some common use cases for `Types` include:

   - Converting string IDs to MongoDB ObjectIds:
     ```javascript
     const objectId = Types.ObjectId(stringId);
     ```

   - Checking if a value is a valid ObjectId:
     ```javascript
     if (Types.ObjectId.isValid(someId)) {
       // Do something
     }
     ```

   - Working with other MongoDB-specific types like Decimal128 or Mixed.

5. In the context of a controller file (brand.controller.js), it's likely that `Types` is being used to handle ObjectIds when querying the database, validating input, or formatting output related to brand data.

While this single line doesn't define a function or class, it's setting up the ability to use Mongoose's `Types` functionality within the controller file, which is crucial for proper data handling when working with MongoDB through Mongoose.

### Parameters

The code snippet you provided:

```javascript
const { Types } = require("mongoose");
```

This line is using object destructuring to extract the `Types` object from the Mongoose library. It's not a function or class definition, but rather an import statement.

The `Types` object from Mongoose provides various utilities for working with MongoDB data types. It doesn't take any parameters itself, as it's just an object containing several properties and methods.

Some common uses of `Types` include:

1. `Types.ObjectId()`: Creates a new ObjectId.
2. `Types.ObjectId.isValid()`: Checks if a string is a valid ObjectId.

For example:

```javascript
const id = new Types.ObjectId();
const isValid = Types.ObjectId.isValid('someIdString');
```

If you're looking for information about a specific function or class that uses `Types`, you would need to provide more context or the specific part of the code you're interested in.

### Return

The code snippet you provided:

```javascript
const { Types } = require("mongoose");
```

This line is importing the `Types` object from the Mongoose library. It doesn't define a function or class that returns anything directly.

The `Types` object in Mongoose provides various schema type constructors and utility methods for working with MongoDB data types. Some common uses of `Types` include:

1. Creating ObjectIds:
   ```javascript
   const id = new Types.ObjectId();
   ```

2. Checking if a string is a valid ObjectId:
   ```javascript
   const isValid = Types.ObjectId.isValid(someString);
   ```

3. Accessing specific Mongoose schema types:
   ```javascript
   const StringType = Types.String;
   const NumberType = Types.Number;
   ```

So, while this line itself doesn't return anything, it makes the `Types` object available for use in the rest of the file, allowing you to work with Mongoose's data types and perform related operations.

# ObjectId /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:09:51

ObjectId is a special data type used in MongoDB to generate unique identifiers for documents. In the given code snippet, it's being destructured from the Types object, which is likely imported from the MongoDB driver or an ODM like Mongoose. ObjectId is typically used when creating or querying documents in MongoDB, allowing for efficient indexing and retrieval of data based on these unique identifiers. Here's a brief example of how it might be used:

```javascript
const newBrand = new Brand({
  _id: new ObjectId(),
  name: "Example Brand",
  createdAt: new Date()
});

// Or when querying:
const brand = await Brand.findOne({ _id: new ObjectId(brandIdString) });
```

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const { ObjectId } = Types;
```

is not a function or a class definition. It's a destructuring assignment that extracts the `ObjectId` property from an object called `Types`.

Here's what this line typically means in the context of MongoDB and Mongoose (a popular MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js):

1. `Types` is likely referring to the `mongoose.Types` object, which contains various Mongoose SchemaTypes.

2. `ObjectId` is a specific type within Mongoose/MongoDB used for unique identifiers.

3. This line is extracting the `ObjectId` constructor from the `Types` object, making it available for use in the current module.

The purpose of this line is to make the `ObjectId` constructor easily accessible in the current file. It's commonly used for:

1. Creating new ObjectIds
2. Validating or converting string IDs to ObjectId instances
3. Querying the database using ObjectIds

For example, you might use it like this:

```javascript
const newId = new ObjectId();
// or
const isValidId = ObjectId.isValid(someId);
// or in a query
const document = await SomeModel.findOne({ _id: new ObjectId(idString) });
```

This line is typically found at the top of a file where ObjectIds are frequently used, such as in database controllers or services.

### Parameters

The code snippet you've provided doesn't show a complete function or class definition. It's just a single line of code that's destructuring the `ObjectId` property from the `Types` object.

Here's what this line does:

```javascript
const { ObjectId } = Types;
```

This is using JavaScript's object destructuring to extract the `ObjectId` property from the `Types` object and assign it to a constant variable also named `ObjectId`.

This line doesn't define a function or a class, and it doesn't take any parameters. It's simply creating a reference to the `ObjectId` constructor that's part of the `Types` object.

The `Types` object and its `ObjectId` property are likely coming from a database library, most probably MongoDB. In MongoDB, `ObjectId` is used to generate unique identifiers for documents.

If you want to know about parameters for `ObjectId`, you would typically use it like this:

```javascript
const id = new ObjectId();  // creates a new ObjectId
// or
const id = new ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011");  // creates an ObjectId from a 24-character hex string
```

But again, this is just based on common usage. The actual implementation might vary depending on the specific library or context in which it's being used.

### Return

The code snippet you provided:

```javascript
const { ObjectId } = Types;
```

This line of code is not a function or class definition. Instead, it's using object destructuring to extract the `ObjectId` property from the `Types` object.

Here's what it does:

1. It assumes there's an object or module named `Types`.
2. From this `Types` object, it extracts the `ObjectId` property.
3. It creates a constant named `ObjectId` that now refers to the extracted property.

Typically, this `ObjectId` is a constructor function or class used in MongoDB-related operations, often through an ODM (Object-Document Mapper) like Mongoose.

`ObjectId` is commonly used to:
- Generate unique identifiers for MongoDB documents
- Convert string IDs to MongoDB ObjectId types
- Validate if a given string is a valid ObjectId

So, while this line itself doesn't return anything, it makes the `ObjectId` functionality available for use in the rest of the file where this destructuring occurs.

To give you a more complete answer about what specific functionality this `ObjectId` provides, I would need to see more context from the file, particularly how `Types` is defined or imported.

# CampaignStatus /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:10:23

In this code snippet, `CampaignStatus` is likely an enumeration or object imported from a constants file located at `../../common/constant.js`. It probably defines various statuses that a campaign can have in the application, such as "active," "paused," or "completed." This import allows the `brand.controller.js` file to use these predefined campaign statuses, ensuring consistency across the application. Here's a possible example of what `CampaignStatus` might look like in the constants file:

```javascript
// ../../common/constant.js
exports.CampaignStatus = {
  ACTIVE: 'active',
  PAUSED: 'paused',
  COMPLETED: 'completed',
  DRAFT: 'draft'
};
```

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const { CampaignStatus } = require("../../common/constant");
```

is importing a specific property or object called `CampaignStatus` from a module located at "../../common/constant".

The purpose of this import is to bring in a set of predefined constants that represent different statuses a campaign can have. These statuses are likely used throughout the application to manage the state of campaigns.

While I can't see the exact contents of the `constant.js` file, typically, `CampaignStatus` might look something like this:

```javascript
const CampaignStatus = {
  DRAFT: 'DRAFT',
  PENDING: 'PENDING',
  ACTIVE: 'ACTIVE',
  PAUSED: 'PAUSED',
  COMPLETED: 'COMPLETED',
  CANCELLED: 'CANCELLED'
};
```

By importing and using these constants, the code ensures consistency in status representation across the application. It helps prevent typos and makes it easier to update statuses in one place if needed.

In the context of `brand.controller.js`, these status constants are likely used to set or check the status of campaigns associated with brands. For example, they might be used in functions that create, update, or query campaigns.

### Parameters

The code snippet you provided is not a function or a class definition. It's a destructuring assignment that imports a constant named `CampaignStatus` from a module.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. `require("../../common/constant")` is importing a module located at "../../common/constant" relative to the current file's location.

2. The `{ CampaignStatus }` syntax is using object destructuring to extract a specific export named `CampaignStatus` from the imported module.

So, `CampaignStatus` is likely an enumeration or object defined in the "../../common/constant" module that contains various campaign status values.

To answer your question directly: This line doesn't define a function or class that takes parameters. It's simply importing a constant named `CampaignStatus` from another file.

If you want to know what values or properties `CampaignStatus` might have, you'd need to look at the definition in the "../../common/constant" file.

### Return

The code snippet you've provided is not a function or a class definition. It's actually a destructuring assignment that imports a specific property from a module.

Let's break it down:

1. `require("../../common/constant")` is importing a module located at "../../common/constant" relative to the current file's location.

2. `{ CampaignStatus }` is using object destructuring to extract a specific property named `CampaignStatus` from the imported module.

3. `const { CampaignStatus }` is declaring a constant variable named `CampaignStatus` and assigning it the value of the `CampaignStatus` property from the imported module.

So, this line of code is not returning anything directly. Instead, it's making the `CampaignStatus` from the "constant.js" file available for use in the current file.

The actual content or structure of `CampaignStatus` would depend on how it's defined in the "../../common/constant" module. It could be an object, an enum, or any other data type. To know exactly what `CampaignStatus` contains, you'd need to look at the definition in the "constant.js" file.

# BrandModel /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:11:00

In the code snippet `const BrandModel = require("../models/brand/brand.model")`, BrandModel is likely a Mongoose model or a similar database model representing the structure and behavior of a "Brand" entity in the application. It's being imported from a file located at "../models/brand/brand.model.js" relative to the current file's location. This model typically defines the schema, methods, and other properties related to the Brand entity, which can be used for database operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting brand records. Here's a simple example of what the brand.model.js file might contain:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const brandSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  logo: String,
  description: String
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Brand', brandSchema);
```

### Use of method

The line of code you provided:

```javascript
const BrandModel = require("../models/brand/brand.model");
```

is an import statement in JavaScript (specifically, in Node.js). Its purpose is to import a module that defines a model for a "Brand" in your application. Here's a breakdown of what this line does and why it's important:

1. Purpose:
   - It imports the Brand model, which is likely a Mongoose schema or some other type of database model.
   - This model probably defines the structure and behavior of "Brand" objects in your application.

2. Usage:
   - By importing this model, the controller can interact with the Brand data in the database.
   - It allows the controller to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Brand records.

3. Structure:
   - The `../` indicates that it's looking in the parent directory.
   - Then it goes into the `models/brand/` subdirectory.
   - Finally, it imports the `brand.model.js` file.

4. Context:
   - This is typically used in a controller file, which handles the logic between the routes (user requests) and the data models.
   - The controller would use this model to process requests related to brands, such as creating new brands, retrieving brand information, updating brand details, or deleting brands.

5. Best Practices:
   - This follows the principle of separation of concerns, keeping the data model separate from the controller logic.
   - It allows for better organization and maintainability of the code.

In summary, this line is crucial for the brand controller to interact with the brand data in your application, enabling it to handle various operations related to brands as requested by the client or other parts of your application.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const BrandModel = require("../models/brand/brand.model");
```

This line of code is not a function or class declaration. It's a module import statement using Node.js's CommonJS module system.

Here's what it does:

1. It uses the `require` function to import a module.
2. The path "../models/brand/brand.model" is relative to the current file's location.
3. It assigns the imported module to the constant variable `BrandModel`.

So, `BrandModel` is likely to be either:
- A class definition for a Brand model
- An object containing methods related to Brand operations
- A Mongoose model (if you're using MongoDB with Mongoose)

This line doesn't take any parameters itself. It's just importing functionality defined elsewhere in your project structure.

To know what parameters the actual `BrandModel` might accept, you'd need to look at the implementation in the "../models/brand/brand.model" file. The usage of `BrandModel` in other parts of your code would also give clues about its structure and the parameters it might accept for various operations.

### Return

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const BrandModel = require("../models/brand/brand.model");
```

This line is importing a module (likely a Mongoose model) from the file located at "../models/brand/brand.model.js" relative to the current file's location.

The `BrandModel` is most likely a Mongoose model that represents the schema and provides methods for interacting with a "Brand" collection in a MongoDB database. 

Typically, a Mongoose model would provide methods such as:

1. `create()` - for creating new documents
2. `find()` - for querying documents
3. `findById()` - for finding a document by its ID
4. `findOneAndUpdate()` - for finding a document and updating it
5. `deleteOne()` - for deleting a document

And other similar methods for database operations.

The actual structure and methods of `BrandModel` would depend on how it's defined in the "brand.model.js" file. Without seeing the contents of that file, we can't say exactly what properties or methods it might have, but it's safe to assume it provides an interface for CRUD operations on brand data in the database.

# CampaignModel /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:11:36

In this code snippet, CampaignModel is likely a reference to a Mongoose model for campaigns associated with brands. The model is defined in a separate file located at /src/creator/models/brand/campaign.model.js. This model probably defines the schema and methods for interacting with campaign documents in a MongoDB database. The require statement imports this model so it can be used in the current file, which appears to be a controller for brand-related operations.

Here's a simple example of what the campaign.model.js file might look like:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const campaignSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  brand: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Brand' },
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  budget: Number
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Campaign', campaignSchema);
```

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const CampaignModel = require("../models/brand/campaign.model");
```

is importing a module, specifically a model called `CampaignModel` from a file located at `../models/brand/campaign.model.js` relative to the current file's location.

The purpose of this line is to make the `CampaignModel` available in the current file (brand.controller.js) so that it can be used. 

Typically, in a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

1. Models (like `CampaignModel`) represent the data structure and business logic of your application. They usually interact with the database and define the shape of your data.

2. Controllers (like brand.controller.js where this import is happening) handle the application logic. They use models to interact with data and prepare it for the view or process incoming requests.

By importing `CampaignModel`, the brand controller can likely perform operations related to campaigns, such as:

- Creating new campaigns
- Retrieving campaign data
- Updating campaign information
- Deleting campaigns

Without seeing the rest of the code in brand.controller.js, it's hard to say exactly how `CampaignModel` is being used, but it's safe to assume that it's being utilized to manage campaign-related data and operations within the brand controller.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const CampaignModel = require("../models/brand/campaign.model");
```

This line is importing a module (likely a Mongoose model) from the file located at "../models/brand/campaign.model". The `CampaignModel` itself is not a function or class that takes parameters in this context.

This import statement doesn't show any parameters being passed. It's simply making the `CampaignModel` available for use in the current file.

If you want to know what parameters the `CampaignModel` might accept when creating new instances or querying, you would need to look at the actual implementation in the "campaign.model.js" file. Typically, for a Mongoose model:

1. When creating a new document: `new CampaignModel({...})` would take an object with the fields defined in the schema.
2. For querying: methods like `CampaignModel.find()`, `CampaignModel.findOne()`, etc., would take query parameters as defined by Mongoose.

But without seeing the actual model definition, it's not possible to give a precise answer about what specific parameters it might accept.

### Return

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const CampaignModel = require("../models/brand/campaign.model");
```

This line is importing a module, specifically a model called `CampaignModel` from a file located at `../models/brand/campaign.model.js` relative to the current file's location.

In Node.js and JavaScript, when you use `require()`, it typically returns whatever is exported from the specified module. The exact return value depends on how the `campaign.model.js` file is structured and what it exports. 

Common patterns for model files in Node.js applications (especially those using frameworks like Express with MongoDB) include:

1. Exporting a Mongoose model:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = mongoose.model('Campaign', campaignSchema);
   ```

2. Exporting an object with methods:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     create: function() { ... },
     find: function() { ... },
     // other methods
   };
   ```

3. Exporting a class:
   ```javascript
   class CampaignModel {
     // methods and properties
   }
   module.exports = CampaignModel;
   ```

Without seeing the contents of the `campaign.model.js` file, it's impossible to say exactly what `CampaignModel` contains. It could be a Mongoose model, a class, an object with methods, or any other JavaScript construct that the file exports.

The purpose of this line is to make the `CampaignModel` available in the current file (`brand.controller.js`) so that it can be used to interact with campaign data, likely in a database or some other data store.

# BrandPartners /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:12:10

In this code snippet, `BrandPartners` is likely a Mongoose model representing brand partners in a MongoDB database. The `require` statement is importing this model from a file located at `../../brand/models/brandpartners.model.js` relative to the current file's location. This model can be used to perform database operations (like creating, reading, updating, or deleting brand partner records) within the `brand.controller.js` file. Here's a simple example of how it might be used:

```javascript
// Create a new brand partner
const newPartner = new BrandPartners({
  name: 'Example Partner',
  industry: 'Technology'
});
await newPartner.save();

// Find all brand partners
const allPartners = await BrandPartners.find();
```

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const BrandPartners = require("../../brand/models/brandpartners.model");
```

is an import statement in JavaScript (specifically for Node.js environments). Its purpose is to import a module or model defined in another file.

Let's break it down:

1. `const BrandPartners`: This declares a constant variable named `BrandPartners`.

2. `require("../../brand/models/brandpartners.model")`: This is using Node.js's `require` function to import a module.

   - The path `"../../brand/models/brandpartners.model"` is a relative path to the file being imported.
   - `../../` means "go up two directory levels"
   - Then it goes into the `brand` directory, then the `models` subdirectory
   - Finally, it's importing the `brandpartners.model` file (likely `brandpartners.model.js`)

The purpose of this line is to make the `BrandPartners` model (or whatever is exported from the `brandpartners.model.js` file) available in the current file. This model likely defines the structure and behavior of brand partner data in the application.

In the context of a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

- This is being imported in a controller file (`brand.controller.js`)
- It's importing a model (`brandpartners.model`)

This suggests that the `brand.controller.js` file will use the `BrandPartners` model to perform operations related to brand partners, such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting brand partner data.

### Parameters

The code snippet you've provided:

```javascript
const BrandPartners = require("../../brand/models/brandpartners.model");
```

This line is not a function or a class definition. It's a module import statement using Node.js's CommonJS `require` function.

Specifically:

1. It's importing a module (likely a model definition) from the file located at "../../brand/models/brandpartners.model.js" relative to the current file's location.

2. The imported module is being assigned to the constant variable `BrandPartners`.

3. This `BrandPartners` is likely a Mongoose model or some other kind of database model that represents the "BrandPartners" entity in your application.

Since this is just an import statement, it doesn't take any parameters. The `require` function itself takes a single parameter, which is the path to the module being imported.

To know what parameters the actual `BrandPartners` model or any of its methods might take, we'd need to see the contents of the "brandpartners.model.js" file or how `BrandPartners` is used in the rest of the "brand.controller.js" file.

### Return

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const BrandPartners = require("../../brand/models/brandpartners.model");
```

This line of code is not a function or class declaration itself. Instead, it's importing (requiring) a module from a specific file path.

Here's what this line does:

1. It uses Node.js's `require` function to import a module.
2. The module being imported is located at "../../brand/models/brandpartners.model".
3. The imported module is assigned to the constant variable `BrandPartners`.

What this `BrandPartners` variable contains depends on what is exported from the "brandpartners.model.js" file. Typically, in a model file, you might expect to find:

- A Mongoose schema and model definition
- A class representing the BrandPartners entity
- An object with methods related to BrandPartners

Without seeing the contents of the "brandpartners.model.js" file, we can't say exactly what `BrandPartners` contains. It could be a model, a class, an object with methods, or any other JavaScript construct that the file exports.

To know precisely what `BrandPartners` contains and what it can return, you would need to examine the contents of the "brandpartners.model.js" file.

# CampaignTargetModel /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:12:45

The CampaignTargetModel is likely a Mongoose schema or model representing the structure and behavior of campaign targets in a database. It's imported from a file located at "../models/brand/campaigntarget.model.js" relative to the current file's location. This model is typically used to interact with the database, allowing operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting campaign target data. Here's a simplified example of what the CampaignTargetModel might look like:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const campaignTargetSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  targetAudience: String,
  budget: Number,
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('CampaignTarget', campaignTargetSchema);
```

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided is importing a model called `CampaignTargetModel` from a file located at `../models/brand/campaigntarget.model.js`.

The purpose of this import is to make the `CampaignTargetModel` available for use in the `brand.controller.js` file. 

In the context of a typical web application structure:

1. Models (like `CampaignTargetModel`) usually represent data structures and business logic. They often correspond to database tables or collections.

2. Controllers (like `brand.controller.js`) typically contain the logic that handles requests, interacts with models, and sends responses.

By importing `CampaignTargetModel` into the brand controller, it allows the controller to:

- Create new campaign targets
- Retrieve campaign target data
- Update existing campaign targets
- Delete campaign targets
- Perform any other operations related to campaign targets

Without seeing the actual implementation of `CampaignTargetModel` or how it's used in the controller, we can't be more specific. However, based on its name, it likely represents a model for managing targeting information for campaigns, possibly in the context of brand management or marketing.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const CampaignTargetModel = require("../models/brand/campaigntarget.model");
```

This line is importing a module (likely a Mongoose model) from the file located at "../models/brand/campaigntarget.model". The `require` function is used to import the module and assign it to the constant `CampaignTargetModel`.

In this context, `CampaignTargetModel` is not a function or class that takes parameters directly. Instead, it's likely a Mongoose model that represents the schema and provides methods for interacting with a "campaign target" collection in a MongoDB database.

To use this model, you would typically call methods on it or create instances of it, like:

```javascript
// Creating a new document
const newTarget = new CampaignTargetModel({ /* data */ });

// Finding documents
CampaignTargetModel.find({ /* query */ });

// Updating documents
CampaignTargetModel.updateOne({ /* query */ }, { /* update */ });

// etc.
```

The actual parameters for these operations would depend on the schema defined in the campaigntarget.model.js file and the specific database operations you want to perform.

If you need to know the exact structure and methods available on this model, you would need to examine the contents of the "../models/brand/campaigntarget.model" file.

### Return

The line of code you've provided is an import statement in JavaScript, specifically for a Node.js environment. It's not a function or class definition, but rather it's importing a model from another file. Here's what it does:

1. `require("../models/brand/campaigntarget.model")` is loading the module defined in the file `campaigntarget.model.js` located in the `../models/brand/` directory relative to the current file.

2. The result of this `require` call is being assigned to the constant `CampaignTargetModel`.

3. Typically, in a Node.js/Express application using Mongoose (a MongoDB ODM), this kind of import would be bringing in a Mongoose model.

So, `CampaignTargetModel` is likely to be a Mongoose model that represents the schema and provides methods for interacting with a 'campaign target' collection in a MongoDB database.

While this line itself doesn't return anything, `CampaignTargetModel` would typically provide methods like:

- `CampaignTargetModel.find()` - to query documents
- `CampaignTargetModel.create()` - to create new documents
- `CampaignTargetModel.updateOne()` - to update documents
- `CampaignTargetModel.deleteOne()` - to delete documents

And so on, depending on how the model is defined in the `campaigntarget.model.js` file.

To know exactly what methods and properties `CampaignTargetModel` has, you'd need to look at the definition in the `campaigntarget.model.js` file.

# CategoryModel /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:13:17

In this code snippet, `CategoryModel` is likely a reference to a database model or schema for categories, specifically related to brands. It's being imported from a file located at "../models/brand/category.model.js" relative to the current file's location. The `CategoryModel` probably defines the structure and behavior of category data in the application, possibly using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) like Mongoose for MongoDB. This model can be used to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on category data in the database.

Here's a simple example of what the `category.model.js` file might contain:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const categorySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  description: String,
  parentCategory: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Category' }
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Category', categorySchema);
```

### Use of method

The line of code you provided:

```javascript
const CategoryModel = require("../models/brand/category.model");
```

is an import statement in JavaScript (specifically for Node.js environment). Its purpose is to import a model called `CategoryModel` from a file located at `"../models/brand/category.model"`.

Here's a breakdown of what this likely means:

1. `CategoryModel` is probably a Mongoose model (if you're using MongoDB with Mongoose) or some other kind of database model that represents a "category" in your application.

2. The model is defined in a file named `category.model.js` which is located in the `models/brand` directory, relative to the current file's location.

3. By importing this model, the current file (which seems to be `brand.controller.js` based on your description) can interact with the "category" data in your database. This could include operations like:
   - Creating new categories
   - Retrieving categories
   - Updating category information
   - Deleting categories

4. The controller (brand.controller.js) is likely responsible for handling the business logic related to brands and categories, and it uses the `CategoryModel` to perform database operations as part of this logic.

Without seeing more of the code, it's hard to say exactly how `CategoryModel` is used, but typically it would be used to create, read, update, or delete category documents in your database.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const CategoryModel = require("../models/brand/category.model");
```

This line is not defining a function or a class. Instead, it's using the `require` function to import a module.

Specifically:

1. It's importing a module (likely a Mongoose model) from the file located at "../models/brand/category.model".
2. The imported module is being assigned to the constant variable `CategoryModel`.

The `require` function takes a single parameter, which is the path to the module you want to import. In this case, the parameter is "../models/brand/category.model".

To understand what parameters the actual `CategoryModel` might take, we would need to see the contents of the "category.model.js" file. Typically, if it's a Mongoose model, it wouldn't directly take parameters, but would instead define the schema and methods for a MongoDB collection.

### Return

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const CategoryModel = require("../models/brand/category.model");
```

This line is importing a module, specifically a model called `CategoryModel` from a file located at `../models/brand/category.model.js` relative to the current file's location.

Without seeing the actual content of the `category.model.js` file, I can't tell you exactly what `CategoryModel` contains. However, in typical Node.js/Express applications using MongoDB and Mongoose (which is a common setup), this would likely be a Mongoose model.

A Mongoose model usually represents a collection in your MongoDB database and provides an interface for querying and manipulating documents in that collection. It would typically define the schema for documents in that collection and provide methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

So, `CategoryModel` is likely to be an object that includes:

1. A schema definition for category documents
2. Methods for creating new categories
3. Methods for querying categories
4. Methods for updating categories
5. Methods for deleting categories

But again, to know exactly what it returns or contains, you'd need to look at the actual content of the `category.model.js` file.

# ContentTypesModel /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:13:50

The `ContentTypesModel` in this code snippet is likely a reference to a database model or schema definition for content types. It's being imported from a file located at "../models/content_types.model.js" relative to the current file's location. This model probably defines the structure and behavior of content types in the application, possibly including fields like name, description, or associated metadata. Here's a simple example of what the ContentTypesModel might look like:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const contentTypeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  description: String,
  fields: [{ name: String, type: String }]
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('ContentType', contentTypeSchema);
```

### Use of method

The line of code you provided:

```javascript
const ContentTypesModel = require("../models/content_types.model");
```

is not a function or class itself, but rather an import statement. It's importing a model (likely a Mongoose model if this is a Node.js/Express application using MongoDB) from a file located at "../models/content_types.model.js".

The purpose of this line is to make the ContentTypesModel available in the current file (brand.controller.js) so that it can be used to interact with the database, specifically for operations related to content types.

Typically, in a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

1. Models (like ContentTypesModel) represent the data structure and business logic.
2. Controllers (like brand.controller.js) handle the application logic, processing requests, interacting with models, and sending responses.

By importing ContentTypesModel into the brand controller, the controller can perform database operations related to content types. This might include actions like:

- Retrieving all content types
- Creating new content types
- Updating existing content types
- Deleting content types
- Querying content types based on certain criteria

Without seeing the rest of the controller file, it's hard to say exactly how ContentTypesModel is being used, but it's likely being utilized in one or more of these ways within the various controller methods.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const ContentTypesModel = require("../models/content_types.model");
```

This line is not defining a function or class that takes parameters. Instead, it's using the `require` function to import a module (likely a model) from a file located at "../models/content_types.model.js" relative to the current file's location.

The `ContentTypesModel` is likely a model definition or a class exported from the "content_types.model.js" file. To know what parameters it might take (if any), we would need to see the actual implementation of the `ContentTypesModel` in the "content_types.model.js" file.

If you're asking about how to use `ContentTypesModel` after this import, it would depend on what exactly is exported from the "content_types.model.js" file. It could be a class constructor, an object with methods, or something else entirely.

Without more context about the implementation of `ContentTypesModel`, it's not possible to specify what parameters it might accept.

### Return

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const ContentTypesModel = require("../models/content_types.model");
```

is not a function or a class definition. Instead, it's importing a module (likely a model) from a file named "content_types.model.js" located in the "../models/" directory relative to the current file.

What this line does:

1. It uses Node.js's `require` function to import the module.
2. It assigns the imported module to the constant `ContentTypesModel`.

The exact nature of what `ContentTypesModel` contains depends on what's exported from the "content_types.model.js" file. Typically, in a model file, you might expect to find:

1. A Mongoose schema and model definition
2. A class that defines methods for interacting with a database
3. An object with various functions related to content types

Without seeing the contents of the "content_types.model.js" file, it's not possible to say exactly what `ContentTypesModel` contains or returns. It's likely that it provides methods or properties for working with content types in your application, possibly including database operations, validation, or other related functionality.

To know exactly what `ContentTypesModel` provides, you'd need to examine the "content_types.model.js" file or any documentation associated with it.

# InsertionOrderModel /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:14:27

The InsertionOrderModel in this code snippet is likely a Mongoose model representing an Insertion Order in a database schema for a brand-related application. It is being imported from a file located at "../models/brand/insertionorder.model.js" relative to the current file's location. This model would define the structure and behavior of Insertion Order documents in the database, including fields, validations, and potentially middleware or methods. Here's a simple example of what the InsertionOrderModel might look like:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const insertionOrderSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  brand: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Brand', required: true },
  campaignName: { type: String, required: true },
  budget: { type: Number, required: true },
  startDate: { type: Date, required: true },
  endDate: { type: Date, required: true }
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('InsertionOrder', insertionOrderSchema);
```

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const InsertionOrderModel = require("../models/brand/insertionorder.model");
```

is importing a model called `InsertionOrderModel` from a file located at `../models/brand/insertionorder.model.js`.

The purpose of this line is to make the `InsertionOrderModel` available in the current file (brand.controller.js) so that it can be used. 

Typically, in a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

1. Models represent the data structure and business logic of your application.
2. Controllers handle the application logic, processing requests, interacting with models, and sending responses.

In this case, `InsertionOrderModel` is likely a Mongoose model (if you're using MongoDB with Mongoose) or some other kind of data model that represents an "Insertion Order" in your application's domain.

The controller (brand.controller.js) is importing this model so it can perform operations related to Insertion Orders, such as:

- Creating new Insertion Orders
- Retrieving Insertion Orders from the database
- Updating existing Insertion Orders
- Deleting Insertion Orders

Without seeing the rest of the controller file or the model file, it's hard to say exactly what operations are being performed, but this import suggests that the brand controller is handling some logic related to Insertion Orders for brands.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const InsertionOrderModel = require("../models/brand/insertionorder.model");
```

This line is importing a module (likely a Mongoose model) from a file located at "../models/brand/insertionorder.model.js". 

The `InsertionOrderModel` itself doesn't take any parameters in this context. It's just being imported/required for use elsewhere in the file.

If `InsertionOrderModel` is indeed a Mongoose model (which is likely given the naming convention), it would typically be used to interact with a MongoDB collection. You would use it to create new documents, query existing ones, update them, etc.

For example, you might use it like this:

```javascript
// To create a new document
const newOrder = new InsertionOrderModel({
  // document properties here
});

// To find documents
const orders = await InsertionOrderModel.find({/* query criteria */});

// To update a document
await InsertionOrderModel.updateOne({/* query criteria */}, {/* update operations */});
```

But again, in the line you provided, it's just importing the model, not using it or passing any parameters to it.

### Return

The code snippet you provided is not a function or class definition. It's an import statement using Node.js's `require` function.

```javascript
const InsertionOrderModel = require("../models/brand/insertionorder.model");
```

This line is importing a module (likely a Mongoose model) from the file located at "../models/brand/insertionorder.model.js" relative to the current file's location.

The `InsertionOrderModel` is likely a Mongoose model that represents the schema and provides methods for interacting with a MongoDB collection for insertion orders.

While I can't see the actual implementation of the `insertionorder.model.js` file, typically, a Mongoose model would provide methods like:

1. Creating new documents (insertion orders)
2. Reading existing documents
3. Updating documents
4. Deleting documents
5. Querying the collection

So, `InsertionOrderModel` itself doesn't return anything directly. It's a reference to the model, which you can use to perform database operations related to insertion orders.

For example, you might use it like this in your controller:

```javascript
// Create a new insertion order
const newOrder = await InsertionOrderModel.create({ /* order data */ });

// Find an insertion order by ID
const order = await InsertionOrderModel.findById(orderId);

// Update an insertion order
await InsertionOrderModel.findByIdAndUpdate(orderId, { /* updated data */ });

// Delete an insertion order
await InsertionOrderModel.findByIdAndDelete(orderId);
```

These are just examples, and the actual methods available would depend on how the model is defined in the `insertionorder.model.js` file.

# PartnersModel /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:14:59

In this code snippet, `PartnersModel` is likely a module that defines the structure and behavior of a "partners" entity in the application. It's imported from a file located at "../models/partners.model.js" relative to the current file's location. The `PartnersModel` probably contains methods for interacting with partner data, such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting partner records in a database. Here's a hypothetical example of what the `partners.model.js` file might contain:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const partnerSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  joinDate: Date
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Partner', partnerSchema);
```

### Use of method

The code snippet you provided is not a function or class definition. It's an import statement in JavaScript.

Here's what it does:

1. `require("../models/partners.model")` is importing a module from a file located at "../models/partners.model" relative to the current file's location.

2. `const PartnersModel = ...` is assigning the imported module to a constant variable named `PartnersModel`.

The purpose of this line is to import the `PartnersModel`, which is likely a Mongoose model or some other kind of data model related to partners in the application.

This model is probably used in the `brand.controller.js` file to interact with partner data, possibly for operations like:

- Fetching partner information
- Creating new partner entries
- Updating existing partner data
- Deleting partner records

Without seeing more of the `brand.controller.js` file or the `partners.model.js` file, it's difficult to provide more specific details about how the `PartnersModel` is used. However, its presence in a controller file suggests that it's likely used for handling partner-related operations in the context of brand management.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const PartnersModel = require("../models/partners.model");
```

This line is importing a module called "partners.model" from the "../models" directory and assigning it to the constant variable `PartnersModel`.

In this context, `PartnersModel` is likely a reference to a model (possibly a Mongoose model if you're using MongoDB with Node.js) defined in the "partners.model.js" file.

The `require()` function itself doesn't take any parameters other than the path to the module being imported.

However, it's important to note that this line doesn't define a function or a class that takes parameters. It's simply importing a module. The actual parameters or methods available on `PartnersModel` would depend on how it's defined in the "partners.model.js" file, which is not shown in the provided code snippet.

If you need to know what parameters or methods are available on `PartnersModel`, you would need to examine the contents of the "partners.model.js" file or any documentation associated with it.

### Return

Based on the code snippet you provided:

```javascript
const PartnersModel = require("../models/partners.model");
```

This line of code is importing a module called `partners.model.js` from the `../models` directory. The `PartnersModel` is likely a Mongoose model or a similar database model representation for a "Partners" collection or table.

Typically, such a model would define the schema and provide methods for interacting with the "Partners" data in the database. It doesn't directly return anything in this context; rather, it makes the `PartnersModel` available for use within the `brand.controller.js` file.

The `PartnersModel` object would usually provide methods like:

- `PartnersModel.find()` - to query partners
- `PartnersModel.create()` - to create new partner entries
- `PartnersModel.updateOne()` - to update partner information
- `PartnersModel.deleteOne()` - to remove partner entries

And so on, depending on how it's set up in the `partners.model.js` file.

To know exactly what methods and properties `PartnersModel` provides, you'd need to examine the contents of the `partners.model.js` file.

# PartnerGroupModel /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:15:35

The line `const PartnerGroupModel = require("../models/brand/partnergroups.model");` is importing a Mongoose model named PartnerGroupModel from a file located at "../models/brand/partnergroups.model.js". This model likely represents a schema for partner groups in a brand-related context within a MongoDB database. The PartnerGroupModel can be used to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the partner groups collection in the database. Here's a simple example of how it might be used:

```javascript
// Create a new partner group
const newGroup = new PartnerGroupModel({ name: "Premium Partners", description: "Top-tier partners" });
await newGroup.save();

// Find all partner groups
const allGroups = await PartnerGroupModel.find();

// Update a partner group
await PartnerGroupModel.updateOne({ _id: groupId }, { $set: { name: "VIP Partners" } });
```

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided is importing a model called `PartnerGroupModel` from a specific file path. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and context:

1. Purpose:
   This line is importing a Mongoose model (assuming the application is using MongoDB with Mongoose ORM) that represents the schema and provides methods for interacting with a collection of partner groups in the database.

2. Context:
   - The model is likely defined in a file named `partnergroups.model.js` located in the `../models/brand/` directory relative to the current file.
   - This import suggests that the `brand.controller.js` file will be working with partner group data, possibly performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations or other data manipulations related to partner groups.

3. Usage:
   After this import, the `PartnerGroupModel` can be used in the controller to:
   - Create new partner group documents
   - Query for existing partner groups
   - Update partner group information
   - Delete partner groups
   - Perform any custom methods defined in the model

4. Relationship to Brands:
   Given that this is in a `brand.controller.js` file, it's likely that partner groups are related to brands in some way. For example, brands might belong to partner groups, or partner groups might be associated with multiple brands.

In summary, this line of code is bringing in the necessary model to work with partner group data within the brand controller, allowing the controller to perform database operations related to partner groups in the context of brand management.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const PartnerGroupModel = require("../models/brand/partnergroups.model");
```

This line is importing a module (likely a Mongoose model) from a file located at "../models/brand/partnergroups.model.js" relative to the current file's location.

The `require` function in Node.js doesn't take any parameters other than the path to the module you're importing. In this case, the parameter is the string "../models/brand/partnergroups.model".

However, it's important to note that this line of code is not defining a function or class that takes parameters. It's simply importing a module and assigning it to the constant `PartnerGroupModel`.

If you want to know what parameters the actual `PartnerGroupModel` might accept, you would need to look at the definition of that model in the "../models/brand/partnergroups.model.js" file. Typically, for a Mongoose model, you would use it like this:

```javascript
const newPartnerGroup = new PartnerGroupModel({
  // parameters here, based on the schema definition
});
```

The exact parameters would depend on how the schema for this model is defined in the partnergroups.model.js file.

### Return

The line of code you've provided is not a function or class definition. It's an import statement using Node.js's `require` function. Specifically:

```javascript
const PartnerGroupModel = require("../models/brand/partnergroups.model");
```

This line is doing the following:

1. It's importing (requiring) a module located at "../models/brand/partnergroups.model".
2. It's assigning whatever that module exports to the constant `PartnerGroupModel`.

What `PartnerGroupModel` actually contains depends on what's exported in the "partnergroups.model.js" file. Typically, in a model file, you might expect to find:

1. A Mongoose schema definition
2. A Mongoose model created from that schema
3. Or possibly a class or object with methods for interacting with a database

Without seeing the contents of the "partnergroups.model.js" file, it's impossible to say exactly what `PartnerGroupModel` contains. It could be a constructor function, an object with methods, or any other JavaScript value that the module decides to export.

To know precisely what `PartnerGroupModel` contains and what it can do, you would need to examine the "partnergroups.model.js" file or any documentation associated with it.

# findProductDetail /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:16:05

The `findProductDetail` is likely a function imported from a utility module located at `/src/common/utils/product_info.js`. This function is probably used to retrieve detailed information about a product, possibly from a database or an external API. The code snippet you provided is using destructuring assignment to import this specific function from the module. Here's a possible example of what the `findProductDetail` function might look like:

```javascript
// In /src/common/utils/product_info.js
exports.findProductDetail = async (productId) => {
  // Logic to fetch product details
  const productDetail = await someDataSource.getProduct(productId);
  return productDetail;
};
```

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const { findProductDetail } = require("../../common/utils/product_info");
```

is importing a function named `findProductDetail` from a module located at "../../common/utils/product_info".

The purpose of `findProductDetail` is not explicitly defined in this snippet, but based on its name and context, we can infer that:

1. It's likely a utility function used to retrieve detailed information about a product.

2. It's probably used within the brand controller to fetch specific product details when needed.

3. It's part of a common utility module, suggesting it might be used across different parts of the application, not just in the brand controller.

Without seeing the implementation of `findProductDetail` or how it's used within the brand controller, we can't be more specific about its exact functionality. However, typically, such a function might:

- Take a product identifier (like an ID) as an argument
- Query a database or an external API to get comprehensive information about the product
- Return an object or data structure containing the product's details

To get a more precise understanding of its purpose and functionality, you would need to examine:

1. The implementation of `findProductDetail` in the "product_info.js" file
2. How it's being used within the brand controller
3. Any documentation or comments associated with the function

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const { findProductDetail } = require("../../common/utils/product_info");

This line is importing the `findProductDetail` function from a module located at "../../common/utils/product_info". However, this import statement alone doesn't provide information about the parameters that `findProductDetail` function takes.

To know the exact parameters of the `findProductDetail` function, we would need to see its definition in the "product_info.js" file. Without access to that file, it's not possible to definitively state what parameters it accepts.

If you have access to the "product_info.js" file or its documentation, you should look there for the function definition or any accompanying documentation to determine its parameters.

If you don't have access to that file, you might be able to infer the parameters by looking at how `findProductDetail` is used within the "brand.controller.js" file. The usage of the function would give clues about what parameters it expects.

### Return

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const { findProductDetail } = require("../../common/utils/product_info");
```

This is using destructuring assignment to import a specific function named `findProductDetail` from a module located at "../../common/utils/product_info".

Without seeing the actual implementation of `findProductDetail` in the "product_info.js" file, I can't tell you exactly what it returns. However, based on its name, we can make some educated guesses:

1. It's likely a function that searches for and retrieves detailed information about a product.

2. It probably takes some kind of identifier (like a product ID) as an argument.

3. It might return an object containing various details about the product, such as:
   - Product name
   - Description
   - Price
   - Category
   - Brand
   - Specifications
   - Images
   - Availability
   - Reviews
   - etc.

4. It could potentially return a Promise if it's performing an asynchronous operation (like fetching data from a database or an API).

5. If the product isn't found, it might return null, undefined, or throw an error.

To know exactly what it returns, you'd need to look at the implementation of `findProductDetail` in the "product_info.js" file, or check if there's any documentation for this function.

# CampaignProductsModel /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:16:41

CampaignProductsModel is likely a Mongoose model or a similar database model representing campaign products for a brand. It's imported from a file located at "../models/brand/campaign_product.model.js" relative to the current file's location. This model probably defines the schema and methods for interacting with campaign product data in the database. Here's a hypothetical example of what the model might look like:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const campaignProductSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  productName: String,
  campaignId: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  price: Number,
  // other relevant fields
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('CampaignProduct', campaignProductSchema);
```

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided is importing a model called `CampaignProductsModel` from a file located at `"../models/brand/campaign_product.model"`.

In the context of a Node.js application (likely using a framework like Express), this import statement suggests that `CampaignProductsModel` is probably a database model definition, likely for a MongoDB collection (if using Mongoose) or a table (if using SQL with an ORM like Sequelize).

The purpose of this model would be to define the structure and behavior of "campaign products" in your application. Some potential uses and characteristics of this model might include:

1. Defining the schema or structure of campaign products (fields like product name, campaign ID, price, etc.)
2. Providing methods to interact with the database for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on campaign products
3. Defining any middleware or hooks related to campaign product operations
4. Potentially including validation rules for campaign product data

This model is being imported into a controller file (`brand.controller.js`), which suggests that it will be used to handle database operations related to campaign products within the context of brand-related functionality in your application.

Without seeing the actual implementation of the model and how it's used in the controller, it's difficult to provide more specific details. However, in general, this import allows the controller to use the `CampaignProductsModel` to interact with campaign product data in the database.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const CampaignProductsModel = require("../models/brand/campaign_product.model");
```

This line is importing a module (likely a model definition) from a file located at "../models/brand/campaign_product.model". The `require` function in Node.js is used to import modules.

In this case, `CampaignProductsModel` is not a function or a class that takes parameters directly. It's a reference to whatever is exported from the "campaign_product.model" file.

Typically, in a model file, you might find:

1. A Mongoose schema definition
2. A model created from that schema
3. Or an object with methods for interacting with a database

To know what parameters or methods `CampaignProductsModel` might have, you'd need to look at the contents of the "campaign_product.model" file. The actual usage of `CampaignProductsModel` would depend on how it's defined in that file.

For example, if it's a Mongoose model, you might use it like:

```javascript
const newProduct = new CampaignProductsModel({
  name: 'Product Name',
  price: 19.99,
  // ... other fields
});
```

Or if it's an object with methods:

```javascript
const products = await CampaignProductsModel.findAll();
```

But without seeing the contents of the model file, it's not possible to say definitively what parameters or methods it might have.

### Return

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const CampaignProductsModel = require("../models/brand/campaign_product.model");
```

This line is importing a module, specifically a model named `CampaignProductsModel` from a file located at `../models/brand/campaign_product.model.js`.

In typical Node.js/Express applications using MongoDB and Mongoose:

1. This model likely represents a Mongoose schema and model for a collection in MongoDB related to campaign products.

2. It's probably defined in the `campaign_product.model.js` file using Mongoose's `mongoose.model()` function.

3. The imported `CampaignProductsModel` is typically an object that provides methods to interact with the corresponding MongoDB collection. These methods could include:
   - `find()`
   - `findOne()`
   - `create()`
   - `updateOne()`
   - `deleteOne()`
   - And other Mongoose query methods

However, to know exactly what this model contains and returns, you'd need to examine the contents of the `campaign_product.model.js` file. The model definition in that file will determine the exact structure and methods available on `CampaignProductsModel`.

This import statement itself doesn't return anything directly. It's making the `CampaignProductsModel` available for use within the `brand.controller.js` file, where it can be used to perform database operations related to campaign products.

# MyLinksModel /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:17:15

In this code snippet, `MyLinksModel` is likely a Mongoose model or a similar database model representing a collection or table for storing link-related data. It's being imported from a file located at "../models/my_links.model.js" relative to the current file's location. This model is probably used in the brand controller to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the "my links" data in the database. Here's a simple example of how it might be used:

```javascript
const MyLinksModel = require("../models/my_links.model");

// Example usage in a controller method
async function getAllLinks(req, res) {
  try {
    const links = await MyLinksModel.find();
    res.json(links);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to fetch links" });
  }
}
```

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const MyLinksModel = require("../models/my_links.model");
```

is an import statement in JavaScript. It's using the CommonJS module system to import a module called "my_links.model" from the "../models" directory.

The purpose of this line is to:

1. Import the MyLinksModel: This is likely a Mongoose model (if you're using MongoDB with Mongoose) or some other kind of data model that represents the structure and behavior of "my links" in your application.

2. Make the model available: By assigning it to the constant `MyLinksModel`, the code makes this model available for use within the current file (brand.controller.js).

3. Prepare for database operations: This model will typically be used to perform database operations related to "my links", such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting link records.

Given that this is in a file named brand.controller.js, it's likely that this model is being imported to handle operations related to brands and their associated links. The controller might use this model to perform actions like:

- Retrieving links associated with a particular brand
- Adding new links to a brand
- Updating existing link information
- Deleting links from a brand's profile

Without seeing more of the code in the controller file, it's difficult to say exactly how the MyLinksModel is being used, but its presence suggests that the brand controller interacts with link data in some way.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const MyLinksModel = require("../models/my_links.model");
```

This line is importing a module (likely a Mongoose model) from a file located at "../models/my_links.model". The `require` function in Node.js doesn't take any parameters beyond the path to the module being imported.

However, it's important to note that this line itself is not a function or class definition. It's simply importing a module and assigning it to the constant `MyLinksModel`.

The actual parameters that `MyLinksModel` might accept would depend on how it's defined in the "my_links.model.js" file. Typically, if it's a Mongoose model, you might use it like this:

```javascript
// Creating a new document
const newLink = new MyLinksModel({
  // parameters would go here, based on the schema
});

// Or querying the database
MyLinksModel.find({ /* query parameters */ });
```

But without seeing the contents of the "my_links.model.js" file, we can't say for certain what parameters it might accept. The parameters would be defined by the schema of the model in that file.

### Return

The code snippet you provided:

```javascript
const MyLinksModel = require("../models/my_links.model");
```

This line is importing a module or file named "my_links.model.js" from the "../models" directory. The `require` function in Node.js is used to include external modules.

Without seeing the contents of "my_links.model.js", I can't say exactly what `MyLinksModel` contains, but typically:

1. If "my_links.model.js" exports a class, `MyLinksModel` would be that class.
2. If it exports an object, `MyLinksModel` would be that object.
3. If it exports a function, `MyLinksModel` would be that function.

The name suggests it's likely a model related to user links, possibly for a database schema if you're using an ORM like Mongoose with MongoDB, or it could be a custom data structure.

To know exactly what `MyLinksModel` contains or returns, you'd need to look at the contents of the "my_links.model.js" file, particularly what it's exporting.

# convertEpochToDate /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:17:51

The `convertEpochToDate` function is likely a utility function imported from a common functions file located at `/src/common/commonFunctions.js`. Its purpose is to convert an epoch timestamp (number of seconds since January 1, 1970) into a human-readable date format. Here's a simple example of what this function might look like:

```javascript
function convertEpochToDate(epochTimestamp) {
  return new Date(epochTimestamp * 1000).toISOString().split('T')[0];
}

// Usage
console.log(convertEpochToDate(1623456789)); // Output: "2021-06-11"
```

This function takes an epoch timestamp as input and returns a formatted date string, making it easier to work with dates in the application.

### Use of method

The code snippet you've provided is not a function or class definition itself, but rather an import statement using object destructuring. Let's break it down:

```javascript
const { convertEpochToDate, shortenUrl } = require("../../common/commonFunctions");
```

This line is importing two specific functions from a module located at "../../common/commonFunctions":

1. `convertEpochToDate`: This function is likely used to convert a Unix epoch timestamp (number of seconds since January 1, 1970) to a more readable date format.

2. `shortenUrl`: This function is probably used to create shortened versions of URLs.

The purpose of `convertEpochToDate` specifically:

- It's a utility function that takes an epoch timestamp (usually a large number representing seconds or milliseconds since the Unix epoch) and converts it into a more human-readable date format.
- This is useful when working with timestamps stored in databases or received from APIs, which are often in epoch format for consistency and ease of sorting.
- The function likely returns a Date object or a formatted string representing the date and time corresponding to the given epoch timestamp.

In the context of a brand controller, `convertEpochToDate` might be used for tasks such as:
- Formatting creation or modification dates of brand-related records
- Displaying time-sensitive information (e.g., campaign start/end dates) in a user-friendly format
- Converting user inputs or API data from epoch format to readable dates for processing or display

Without seeing the actual implementation of `convertEpochToDate`, we can't know the exact details, but its general purpose is to make epoch timestamps more accessible and readable in the application's user interface or data processing routines.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet, `convertEpochToDate` is a function that is being imported from a module located at "../../common/commonFunctions".

However, the code you've shown doesn't provide the implementation details of the `convertEpochToDate` function. It only shows that this function is being imported.

To know exactly what parameters this function takes, we would need to see its implementation in the "../../common/commonFunctions" file.

Typically, a function named `convertEpochToDate` would likely take an epoch timestamp as a parameter and convert it to a human-readable date. A common signature might look like this:

```javascript
function convertEpochToDate(epochTimestamp) {
    // Implementation
}
```

But without seeing the actual implementation, I can't say for certain what parameters it takes or how it's used. The function could potentially take additional parameters for formatting or timezone adjustments.

If you need to know the exact parameters, you should check the implementation in the "../../common/commonFunctions" file or any documentation that might exist for this codebase.

### Return

Based on the provided code snippet, `convertEpochToDate` is not a function or class defined in the file `/src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js`. Instead, it's being imported from another file.

The line you've shown is using destructuring assignment to import specific functions from a module:

```javascript
const { convertEpochToDate, shortenUrl } = require("../../common/commonFunctions");
```

This means that `convertEpochToDate` is a function defined in the file `../../common/commonFunctions.js` (relative to the current file's location).

Without seeing the actual implementation of `convertEpochToDate` in the `commonFunctions.js` file, I can't tell you exactly what it returns. However, based on its name, we can make an educated guess:

- `convertEpochToDate` likely takes an epoch timestamp (a number representing seconds or milliseconds since January 1, 1970) as input.
- It probably returns a Date object or a formatted date string representing the date and time corresponding to that epoch timestamp.

For example, it might work something like this:

```javascript
function convertEpochToDate(epoch) {
    return new Date(epoch * 1000); // Assuming epoch is in seconds
}
```

Or it could return a formatted string:

```javascript
function convertEpochToDate(epoch) {
    const date = new Date(epoch * 1000);
    return date.toISOString(); // or any other date format
}
```

To know exactly what it returns and how it works, you'd need to check the implementation in the `../../common/commonFunctions.js` file.

# shortenUrl /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:18:22

The `shortenUrl` function is likely a utility function imported from a file named `commonFunctions.js` located in the `../../common/` directory relative to the current file. It's purpose is probably to take a long URL as input and return a shortened version of that URL. Here's a simple example of what such a function might look like:

```javascript
function shortenUrl(longUrl) {
    // This is a simplified example. In practice, you'd use a more robust algorithm
    const shortCode = Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 6);
    return `https://short.url/${shortCode}`;
}
```

In actual use, this function would be called whenever a URL needs to be shortened within the `brand.controller.js` file.

### Use of method

The code snippet you've provided is not a function or class definition. Instead, it's an import statement using object destructuring in JavaScript. Let's break it down:

```javascript
const { convertEpochToDate, shortenUrl } = require("../../common/commonFunctions");
```

This line is importing two specific functions from a module:

1. `convertEpochToDate`: A function that likely converts an epoch timestamp to a human-readable date format.

2. `shortenUrl`: A function that probably takes a long URL and returns a shortened version of it.

These functions are being imported from a file named `commonFunctions.js` located in the `../../common/` directory relative to the current file.

The `shortenUrl` function, which you specifically asked about, is likely used to create shorter, more manageable versions of long URLs. This can be useful for various purposes, such as:

1. Creating more user-friendly links for sharing
2. Saving space when displaying URLs in a user interface
3. Tracking clicks or other analytics on shared links
4. Improving the aesthetic appearance of URLs in marketing materials or social media posts

Without seeing the actual implementation of `shortenUrl`, we can't know the exact details of how it works, but its general purpose is to take a long URL as input and return a shorter equivalent URL.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet, `shortenUrl` is not a function or class defined in the `brand.controller.js` file. Instead, it's being imported from another module.

The line:

```javascript
const { convertEpochToDate, shortenUrl, } = require("../../common/commonFunctions");
```

is using destructuring assignment to import specific functions from a module called `commonFunctions.js` located in the `../../common/` directory relative to the current file.

To determine the parameters of the `shortenUrl` function, you would need to look at its definition in the `../../common/commonFunctions.js` file. Without seeing that file, it's not possible to say definitively what parameters it takes.

Typically, a function named `shortenUrl` might take a full URL as a parameter and return a shortened version of it, but this is just a guess based on common naming conventions. The actual implementation could be different.

If you need to know the exact parameters, you should check the `commonFunctions.js` file or any documentation associated with it.

### Return

The `shortenUrl` function is being imported from a file located at `../../common/commonFunctions`. Without seeing the actual implementation of this function in the `commonFunctions.js` file, I can't provide specifics about what it returns.

However, based on its name and common practices, a `shortenUrl` function typically does the following:

1. It takes a long URL as input.
2. It generates a shorter version of that URL, often using a URL shortening service or algorithm.
3. It returns the shortened URL as a string.

For example, it might transform a URL like:
`https://www.example.com/very/long/path/to/some/resource?with=parameters`

Into something like:
`https://short.url/abc123`

The exact format of the returned shortened URL would depend on the implementation details in the `commonFunctions.js` file.

To know exactly what this function returns in your specific case, you'd need to check its implementation in the `../../common/commonFunctions.js` file.

# createObjectId /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:18:57

`createObjectId` is likely a utility function imported from a custom module located at `/src/common/utils/mongoose.js`. This function is probably used to create MongoDB ObjectId instances, which are unique identifiers for documents in MongoDB collections. The function might be a wrapper around MongoDB's native `ObjectId` constructor, potentially adding error handling or additional functionality. Here's a possible implementation:

```javascript
// In /src/common/utils/mongoose.js
const { ObjectId } = require('mongodb');

function createObjectId(id) {
  try {
    return new ObjectId(id);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid ObjectId: ${id}`);
  }
}

module.exports = { createObjectId };
```

This function could then be used in the brand controller to create or validate ObjectIds for MongoDB operations.

### Use of method

The `createObjectId` function is a utility function imported from a common utilities file, likely used for working with MongoDB ObjectIDs. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and context:

1. Purpose:
   The `createObjectId` function is typically used to create or convert string IDs to MongoDB ObjectID instances. This is useful when you need to work with ObjectIDs in your database queries or when you're creating new documents that require an ObjectID.

2. Usage in MongoDB:
   In MongoDB, the `_id` field of documents is usually an ObjectID. When you're querying or updating documents using their ID, you often need to convert string representations of IDs to actual ObjectID instances.

3. Common scenarios:
   - Converting a string ID from a request parameter to an ObjectID for database queries
   - Creating new ObjectIDs for new documents
   - Validating that a given string is a valid ObjectID

4. Example of how it might be used:
   ```javascript
   const brandId = req.params.id;
   const objectId = createObjectId(brandId);
   // Now you can use objectId in your MongoDB queries
   const brand = await Brand.findById(objectId);
   ```

5. Implementation:
   While we can't see the actual implementation from the provided code, a typical implementation might look like this:
   ```javascript
   const { ObjectId } = require('mongodb');
   
   const createObjectId = (id) => {
     return new ObjectId(id);
   };
   ```

By importing this function in your `brand.controller.js`, you're making it available for use in your brand-related operations where you need to work with MongoDB ObjectIDs. This helps in maintaining consistency in ID handling across your application and separates the ID creation logic from your controller code.

### Parameters

Based on the provided context, `createObjectId` is a function that is being imported from a utility module. The line of code you've shown is using destructuring to import this function from the file located at "../../common/utils/mongoose".

Without seeing the actual implementation of `createObjectId`, I can't say for certain what parameters it takes. However, typically, functions named `createObjectId` in the context of MongoDB and Mongoose are used to create new ObjectId instances.

In MongoDB, ObjectId is a 12-byte BSON type that is used as the default value for the `_id` field of documents. 

A typical `createObjectId` function might:

1. Take no parameters and generate a new ObjectId.
2. Take a string parameter and convert it to an ObjectId.

For example, it might be used like this:

```javascript
// Generate a new ObjectId
const newId = createObjectId();

// Or convert a string to ObjectId
const idFromString = createObjectId('507f1f77bcf86cd799439011');
```

However, to know exactly what parameters this specific `createObjectId` function takes, you would need to look at its implementation in the "../../common/utils/mongoose" file.

### Return

The `createObjectId` function is not defined in the code snippet you provided. Instead, it's being imported from another file using destructuring assignment.

The line:

```javascript
const { createObjectId } = require("../../common/utils/mongoose");
```

is importing a function named `createObjectId` from a file located at `../../common/utils/mongoose` relative to the current file's location.

Without seeing the implementation of `createObjectId` in the mongoose utils file, I can't say exactly what it returns. However, based on its name and common MongoDB/Mongoose practices, it's likely that this function:

1. Creates and returns a new MongoDB ObjectId.
2. Or, it might convert a string to a MongoDB ObjectId.

In MongoDB, an ObjectId is a 12-byte BSON type that is used as the default value for the `_id` field in documents if the `_id` field is not specified.

A typical usage might look like this:

```javascript
const newId = createObjectId();
// or
const objectId = createObjectId(someStringId);
```

The returned value would be a MongoDB ObjectId, which can be used for document identification in MongoDB operations.

To know exactly what this function returns and how it behaves, you would need to check its implementation in the `../../common/utils/mongoose` file.

# GroupsMaster /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:19:29

In this code snippet, GroupsMaster likely refers to a Mongoose model for a "groups master" collection in a MongoDB database. The line is importing this model from a file located at "../../brand/models/groupsmaster.model.js" relative to the current file's location. This model would define the schema and provide methods for interacting with the "groups master" data in the database. It's being imported so that the brand.controller.js file can use it to perform database operations related to group management within the application.

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const GroupsMaster = require("../../brand/models/groupsmaster.model");
```

is not a function or class itself, but rather an import statement. It's importing a model (likely a Mongoose model if this is a Node.js/Express application using MongoDB) from another file in the project structure.

The purpose of this line is to:

1. Import the GroupsMaster model: This model is likely defined in the file "groupsmaster.model.js" located in the "../../brand/models/" directory relative to the current file.

2. Make the GroupsMaster model available in the current file: After this import, the GroupsMaster model can be used in the current file to perform database operations related to the "GroupsMaster" entity.

The GroupsMaster model itself probably defines the structure and behavior of a "group" or "group master" entity in your application. It might include things like:

- The schema definition for a group (what fields it has)
- Any pre-save or post-save hooks
- Custom methods for the model

Without seeing the actual model definition or how it's used in the rest of the file, it's hard to say exactly what operations it's used for, but typical uses might include:

- Creating new groups
- Querying for existing groups
- Updating group information
- Deleting groups

This import suggests that the brand.controller.js file likely contains functions that handle business logic related to groups, using the GroupsMaster model to interact with the database.

### Parameters

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const GroupsMaster = require("../../brand/models/groupsmaster.model");
```

This line is not defining a function or a class. It's using the `require` statement to import a module.

Specifically:

1. It's importing a module named "groupsmaster.model" from the relative path "../../brand/models/".

2. The imported module is being assigned to a constant variable named `GroupsMaster`.

3. We don't have information about what `GroupsMaster` actually is from this line alone. It could be a class, an object, or any other type of module export.

4. This line doesn't take any parameters itself.

To know what parameters `GroupsMaster` might accept (if it's a function or class constructor), we would need to see the contents of the "groupsmaster.model.js" file. Without that additional context, it's not possible to determine what parameters, if any, it might take.

### Return

Based on the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const GroupsMaster = require("../../brand/models/groupsmaster.model");
```

This line is importing a module or model named "groupsmaster.model" from the specified path. The `require` function in Node.js is used to include external modules.

Without seeing the contents of the "groupsmaster.model" file, it's not possible to say exactly what `GroupsMaster` represents. However, based on common practices:

1. If it's a Mongoose model, `GroupsMaster` would typically be a constructor function for creating documents in a MongoDB collection, with associated methods for querying, updating, and manipulating those documents.

2. If it's a regular JavaScript class or constructor function, `GroupsMaster` could represent a blueprint for creating GroupsMaster objects with properties and methods related to managing groups.

3. If it's an object with methods, `GroupsMaster` might be a collection of functions for performing operations related to groups.

To know exactly what `GroupsMaster` returns or represents, you would need to examine the contents of the "groupsmaster.model" file. The name suggests it's likely related to managing or representing groups in some way, but the specific implementation details would determine its exact functionality and return values.

# PartnersGroup /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:20:01

In the given code snippet, `PartnersGroup` is likely a Mongoose model representing a collection in MongoDB for partner groups. The line is importing this model from a file located at `../../brand/models/partnergroups.model.js` relative to the current file's location. This model can be used to perform database operations (like create, read, update, delete) on the partner groups collection. Here's a simple example of how it might be used:

```javascript
// Creating a new partner group
const newGroup = new PartnersGroup({ name: 'Premium Partners', tier: 1 });
await newGroup.save();

// Finding all partner groups
const allGroups = await PartnersGroup.find();
```

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided:

```javascript
const PartnersGroup = require("../../brand/models/partnergroups.model");
```

is an import statement in JavaScript. It's not a function or a class definition itself, but rather it's importing a module (likely a model) from another file. Let's break down what this line does:

1. It's using the `require` function, which is Node.js's way of importing modules.

2. The path `"../../brand/models/partnergroups.model"` suggests that it's importing a file named `partnergroups.model.js` located in the `brand/models` directory, which is two levels up from the current file's location.

3. The imported module is being assigned to the constant `PartnersGroup`.

The purpose of this line is to make the `PartnersGroup` model available in the current file. Based on the name, it's likely that `PartnersGroup` is a Mongoose model or some other kind of data model that represents a group of partners.

In the context of a controller file (as suggested by the file path you mentioned), this model would typically be used to interact with the database, performing operations like:

- Fetching partner groups
- Creating new partner groups
- Updating existing partner groups
- Deleting partner groups

The controller would use methods provided by this model to handle these database operations in response to HTTP requests, forming part of the application's API for managing partner groups.

### Parameters

The code snippet you provided:

```javascript
const PartnersGroup = require("../../brand/models/partnergroups.model");
```

This line of code is not a function or a class definition. It's a module import statement using the CommonJS `require` function.

Here's what it does:

1. It imports (requires) a module located at the relative path "../../brand/models/partnergroups.model".
2. The imported module (likely a model definition for partner groups) is assigned to the constant variable `PartnersGroup`.

This statement doesn't take any parameters itself. It's used to make the `PartnersGroup` model available in the current file, so you can use it later in your code to interact with the partner groups data, possibly for database operations.

If you want to know about the parameters of specific functions or methods within the `PartnersGroup` model, you would need to look at the actual implementation in the "partnergroups.model.js" file.

### Return

The line of code you provided:

```javascript
const PartnersGroup = require("../../brand/models/partnergroups.model");
```

This line is using the `require` function to import a module, specifically the `partnergroups.model` from the specified path. 

What this returns depends on what is exported from the `partnergroups.model.js` file. Typically, in a model file, you might expect to find:

1. A Mongoose schema and model definition
2. A class representing the PartnersGroup
3. An object with methods related to PartnersGroup operations
4. Or any other structure that defines or interacts with the PartnersGroup data

Without seeing the contents of the `partnergroups.model.js` file, it's not possible to say exactly what `PartnersGroup` contains after this import. It could be a Mongoose model, a class, an object with methods, or something else entirely, depending on what that file exports.

If you need more specific information, you would need to examine the contents of the `partnergroups.model.js` file or how `PartnersGroup` is used in the rest of the `brand.controller.js` file.

# getAllBrandList /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:20:32

The `getAllBrandList` function is an asynchronous controller method that retrieves a list of non-deleted brands from the database, calculates minimum and maximum commissions for each brand based on the partner ID, and returns the enriched brand list to the client. It uses the `BrandModel.find()` method to fetch brands, then iterates over them using `Promise.all()` to concurrently calculate commissions for each brand using the `findMinMaxBrandCommission` function. Finally, it sends a successful response with the updated brand list or handles any errors that occur during the process.

### Use of method

The `getAllBrandList` function is an asynchronous controller function designed to retrieve a list of all non-deleted brands and their associated commission information. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and functionality:

1. It's an API endpoint handler for retrieving brand information.

2. The function first fetches all non-deleted brands from the database using the `BrandModel.find()` method.

3. For each brand, it calculates the minimum and maximum commission values by calling the `findMinMaxBrandCommission` function (which is not shown in the provided code snippet).

4. The commission information (min and max) is then added to each brand object.

5. Finally, it sends a response with:
   - A status code of 201 (CREATED)
   - A success message
   - The list of brands with their commission information

6. If an error occurs during this process, it logs the error and sends an appropriate error response.

Key points:
- It's designed to work with authenticated requests, as it uses `req.user.user_id`.
- It handles potential errors and provides appropriate error responses.
- It uses the `lean()` method for potentially better performance when fetching brand data.
- It processes the brands in parallel using `Promise.all()` for efficiency.

This function would typically be used in a route that needs to display a list of all available brands to a user, possibly in a dashboard or a brand selection interface, where showing commission information is relevant.

### Parameters

The `getAllBrandList` function is an asynchronous function that takes two parameters:

1. `req`: This is the request object, which contains information about the HTTP request made to the server.

2. `res`: This is the response object, which is used to send the HTTP response back to the client.

These parameters are typically provided by the Express.js framework or similar web server middleware when the route handler is called.

In the function body, you can see that it uses `req.user.user_id` to access the `user_id` from the request object, suggesting that user authentication information is expected to be available in the request.

The function doesn't take any additional parameters beyond these standard Express.js request and response objects.

### Return

The `getAllBrandList` function is an asynchronous function that retrieves a list of brands and returns it as a response. Here's a breakdown of what the function does and returns:

1. It fetches all non-deleted brands from the database using `BrandModel.find({ is_deleted: false }).lean()`.

2. For each brand, it calculates the minimum and maximum commissions using the `findMinMaxBrandCommission` function (not shown in the provided code).

3. It adds the calculated `minCommission` and `maxCommission` properties to each brand object.

4. Finally, it returns an HTTP response with:
   - Status code: 201 (CREATED)
   - A JSON object containing:
     - `statusCode`: 201
     - `message`: "Brand list retrive successfully."
     - `data`: An array of brand objects, each containing the brand information along with the calculated `minCommission` and `maxCommission`.

In case of an error, it returns an HTTP response with:
- Status code: 500 (INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
- A JSON object containing:
  - `message`: The error message

So, in summary, this function returns an HTTP response containing either:
1. A successful response with a list of brands and their commission information.
2. An error response if something goes wrong during the process.

The actual data being sent back to the client is the list of brands with their details and commission information.

# brands /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:21:05

In the code snippet `const brands = await BrandModel.find({ is_deleted: false }).lean();`, `brands` is likely an array of brand objects retrieved from a database using Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js. The `BrandModel` is presumably a Mongoose model representing the schema for brands in the database. The `find()` method queries the database for all brand documents where `is_deleted` is false, and `lean()` returns plain JavaScript objects instead of Mongoose documents for better performance. This operation is asynchronous, hence the use of `await`.

### Use of method

The line of code you've provided is part of a function in the `brand.controller.js` file. Its purpose is to retrieve a list of active (not deleted) brands from the database. Let's break it down:

1. `BrandModel`: This is likely a Mongoose model representing the Brand collection in your database.

2. `.find()`: This is a Mongoose method used to query the database. It returns all documents that match the given criteria.

3. `{ is_deleted: false }`: This is the query criteria. It filters the results to only include brands where the `is_deleted` field is set to `false`. This is a common pattern used for soft deletion, where items are marked as deleted rather than being physically removed from the database.

4. `.lean()`: This Mongoose method returns plain JavaScript objects instead of full Mongoose documents. This can be more efficient when you don't need the additional Mongoose features like change tracking.

5. `await`: This keyword indicates that the function is asynchronous and is waiting for the database query to complete before moving on.

6. `const brands = ...`: The results of the query are stored in the `brands` variable.

In summary, this line of code is fetching all active (non-deleted) brands from the database as plain JavaScript objects. This is likely part of a larger function that handles retrieving and possibly sending these brands as a response to an API request or using them for further processing in the application.

### Parameters

Based on the code snippet you provided:

```javascript
const brands = await BrandModel.find({ is_deleted: false }).lean();
```

This line of code is using the Mongoose `find()` method on the `BrandModel`. Here's a breakdown of the parameters:

1. The `find()` method takes an object as its parameter:
   `{ is_deleted: false }`

   This object is the query criteria. It's looking for documents in the Brand collection where the `is_deleted` field is set to `false`.

2. The `lean()` method is called after `find()`, but it doesn't take any parameters. It's used to return plain JavaScript objects instead of Mongoose documents.

So, to directly answer your question:

The `find()` method takes one parameter, which is an object specifying the query criteria `{ is_deleted: false }`.

The `lean()` method doesn't take any parameters.

It's worth noting that this line is part of a larger asynchronous function, as indicated by the `await` keyword. The full function might take its own parameters, but we can't determine that from this single line of code alone.

### Return

The code snippet you provided is part of a function in a controller file. Let's break it down:

```javascript
const brands = await BrandModel.find({ is_deleted: false }).lean();
```

This line of code does the following:

1. It queries the database using the `BrandModel` (which is likely a Mongoose model).
2. The `find()` method is used to retrieve documents from the collection associated with the `BrandModel`.
3. The query filters for documents where `is_deleted` is `false`.
4. The `lean()` method is called to return plain JavaScript objects instead of Mongoose documents, which can be more efficient when you don't need the full Mongoose document functionality.

What this function returns:

- It returns an array of brand objects from the database.
- Each object in the array represents a brand that hasn't been deleted (i.e., `is_deleted: false`).
- The objects are plain JavaScript objects (due to `lean()`), not Mongoose documents.

The `brands` constant will contain this array of brand objects. Typically, in a controller function, this data would then be used to send a response to the client, perhaps like this:

```javascript
res.json(brands);
```

Or it might be used for further processing before sending a response.

Without seeing the entire function, it's hard to say exactly what the final return value is, but this line is retrieving brand data from the database, which is likely a key part of the function's overall purpose.

# is_deleted /src/creator/controllers/brand.controller.js
## Imported Code Object
**Last Updated at:** 22/01/2025, 13:21:43

In the code snippet `const brands = await BrandModel.find({ is_deleted: false }).lean();`, `is_deleted: false` is part of a query condition used to filter documents in the MongoDB database. It specifically looks for documents in the BrandModel collection where the `is_deleted` field is set to `false`. This is a common pattern used for soft deletion, where instead of permanently removing records, they are marked as deleted by setting `is_deleted` to `true`. By querying for `is_deleted: false`, the code retrieves only the active (non-deleted) brand records from the database.

### Use of method

The code snippet you've provided is part of a function or method in the `brand.controller.js` file. The purpose of this line is to retrieve a list of non-deleted brands from the database.

Let's break it down:

1. `BrandModel.find()`: This is likely using Mongoose (an ODM for MongoDB) to query the Brand collection in the database.

2. `{ is_deleted: false }`: This is the query condition. It's looking for documents where the `is_deleted` field is set to `false`. This suggests that the application is using a soft delete approach, where items are marked as deleted rather than being actually removed from the database.

3. `.lean()`: This method is used to return plain JavaScript objects instead of Mongoose documents. It can make queries faster and use less memory, but the returned objects don't have the full functionality of Mongoose documents.

4. `await`: This keyword suggests that `BrandModel.find()` returns a Promise, and the function is waiting for this Promise to resolve before continuing.

5. `const brands`: The result of the query (an array of brand objects) is being stored in this variable.

The overall purpose of this line is to fetch all active (non-deleted) brands from the database as plain JavaScript objects. This could be part of a larger function that might, for example, be responsible for listing all active brands in an admin panel or providing data for a brand selection dropdown in a user interface.

### Parameters

Based on the code snippet you provided:

```javascript
const brands = await BrandModel.find({ is_deleted: false }).lean();
```

The `is_deleted` parameter is not a function or a class. It's actually a property being used in a query object passed to the `find()` method of the `BrandModel`.

Here's a breakdown:

1. `BrandModel` appears to be a Mongoose model for brands.
2. The `find()` method is called on this model.
3. `{ is_deleted: false }` is an object passed to `find()`. This object specifies the query criteria.
4. `is_deleted` is a field in the brand documents stored in the database.
5. The query is looking for all brand documents where `is_deleted` is set to `false`.

So, `is_deleted` is a boolean field in the brand documents, and in this query, it's being used to filter out deleted brands (assuming that when a brand is "deleted", its `is_deleted` field is set to `true` instead of actually removing the document from the database).

The `.lean()` method at the end converts the Mongoose documents to plain JavaScript objects, which can be more efficient when you don't need the full Mongoose document features.

### Return

The code snippet you provided is part of a function that queries a database using Mongoose (a MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js).

Here's what this line does:

```javascript
const brands = await BrandModel.find({ is_deleted: false }).lean();
```

1. It uses the `BrandModel`, which is likely a Mongoose model representing the "Brand" collection in the database.

2. The `find()` method is called on this model with a query parameter `{ is_deleted: false }`. This means it's looking for all documents in the collection where the `is_deleted` field is set to `false`.

3. The `lean()` method is chained to the query. This tells Mongoose to return plain JavaScript objects instead of Mongoose documents, which can be more efficient when you don't need to modify the returned data.

4. The `await` keyword suggests this is inside an async function, and it waits for the database query to complete.

5. The result is stored in the `brands` constant.

What this function returns:

This query will return an array of brand objects from the database that have not been marked as deleted (i.e., where `is_deleted` is `false`). Each object in the array will represent a brand document from the database, containing all the fields of that document, but as a plain JavaScript object (due to the `lean()` method).

For example, the `brands` array might look something like this:

```javascript
[
  { _id: '...', name: 'Brand1', description: '...', is_deleted: false },
  { _id: '...', name: 'Brand2', description: '...', is_deleted: false },
  // ... more brand objects
]
```

The exact structure of each brand object will depend on how your `BrandModel` is defined.
