This code file defines the authentication routes for an Express.js application. Its main purpose is to set up and configure various endpoints related to user authentication and authorization. Key functionalities include:

1. Importing necessary modules, middlewares, validators, and controllers.
2. Setting up routes for user authentication actions such as:
   - Creating a password
   - Logging in
   - Resending password creation links
   - Checking link availability
   - Resetting passwords
   - Checking passwords
   - Logging out
   - Uploading media files
   - Changing passwords

3. Applying appropriate middleware to each route, including:
   - Input validation using custom validators
   - Authentication checks
   - Role-based access control
   - File upload handling

4. Associating each route with its corresponding controller function for handling the request logic.

5. Exporting the router for use in the main application.

This file serves as a central location for managing all authentication-related routes, ensuring proper security measures and input validation are applied consistently across the authentication flow.
