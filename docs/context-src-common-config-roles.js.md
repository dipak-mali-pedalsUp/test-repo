This code defines a roles configuration for an application, likely an impression or brand management system. The main purpose of this file is to centralize the definition of user roles and provide a convenient way to access them.

Key functionality:

1. Role Definition: The code defines four distinct user roles:
   - BrandUser
   - Creator
   - Admin
   - Super Admin

2. Role Access: These roles are stored as properties of the 'roles' object, allowing easy access and reference throughout the application.

3. Role Enumeration: The 'values' function within the 'roles' object returns an array of all defined roles, which can be useful for iterating over roles or populating dropdown menus.

4. Exportability: The 'roles' object is exported, making it available for import and use in other parts of the application.

This configuration file helps maintain consistency in role references across the application and provides a single source of truth for user roles, which is crucial for implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and managing user permissions effectively.
