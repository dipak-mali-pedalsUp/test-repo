This code file defines a set of validation rules for partner-related operations in the impression-backend project. The main purpose of this code is to ensure data integrity and proper input validation for various partner management functions. Here are the key functionalities:

1. approvePartnerRequest: Validates the input for approving a partner request, ensuring that both partner_id and partner_request_status are provided.

2. blackWhitelistPartner: Validates the input for blacklisting or whitelisting a partner, requiring both partner_id and is_blacklisted flag.

3. addToPartnerGroup: Validates the input for adding partners to a group, ensuring that a group_id is provided and that partnerids is a non-empty array.

These validation rules help maintain data consistency and prevent errors by ensuring that all required fields are present and in the correct format before processing partner-related operations. The module exports these validation rules, likely to be used by other parts of the application for input validation.
