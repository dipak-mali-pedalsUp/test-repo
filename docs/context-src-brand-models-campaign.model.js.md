This code defines a Mongoose schema and model for a Campaign in a marketing or advertising context. Here's a summary of its purpose and key functionality:

1. Purpose:
   - To create a structured data model for campaigns within a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
   - To define the properties, types, and default values for campaign-related information.

2. Key Functionality:
   - Defines a schema (campaignSchema) with various fields related to a campaign, such as name, tagline, budget, pricing strategy, and status.
   - Uses references to other models (brand, category, insertion order) to establish relationships between collections.
   - Implements timestamps for tracking creation and update times.
   - Sets default values for several fields to streamline campaign creation.
   - Includes fields for managing campaign status, budget caps, and commission ratios.
   - Allows for soft deletion of campaigns using the 'is_deleted' field.
   - Creates a Mongoose model named 'Campaign' based on the defined schema, which can be used for database operations related to campaigns.

This model serves as a blueprint for creating, reading, updating, and deleting campaign documents in the MongoDB database, providing a structured way to manage campaign data within the application.
