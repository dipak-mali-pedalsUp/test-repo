This code file defines the routes for partner-related operations in an Express.js application, specifically for a brand management system. The key functionalities include:

1. Setting up an Express router for handling partner-related requests.
2. Importing necessary middlewares, validators, and controllers.
3. Defining several routes with different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH) for various partner-related actions.

The main functionalities provided by these routes are:
- Approving follow requests from partners
- Blacklisting or whitelisting partners
- Retrieving partner groups
- Adding partners to groups
- Getting partner counts
- Fetching details of a specific partner
- Retrieving a list of partners

Each route is protected by authentication middleware and restricted to users with the 'branduser' role. Some routes also include validation middleware to ensure the incoming data meets the required format and constraints.

This file serves as a central point for managing partner-related API endpoints, providing a clear structure for handling various partner operations within the brand management system.
