This code file, config.js, serves as a centralized configuration module for a backend application. Its main purposes and key functionalities are:

1. Environment Variable Management: It uses the dotenv package to load environment variables from a .env file, making it easy to manage different configurations for various environments (development, staging, production).

2. Configuration Object: The file exports a 'config' object that acts as a single source of truth for all configuration settings in the application.

3. Getter Methods: It uses getter methods to access environment variables, providing a clean and consistent way to retrieve configuration values throughout the application.

4. Modular Organization: The configuration is organized into logical sections (e.g., mongoose, s3, meta, tiktok, youtube, twitch, azure) for better readability and maintenance.

5. Default Values: Some configurations (like 'port') have default values in case the environment variable is not set.

6. Security: By accessing sensitive information (like API keys and secrets) through environment variables, it helps keep these values out of the codebase, enhancing security.

7. Third-party Service Configurations: It includes settings for various third-party services and APIs (Google, Pinterest, AWS S3, Meta, TikTok, YouTube, Twitch, Azure) that the application likely integrates with.

8. Database Configuration: It provides MongoDB connection details, allowing for easy database setup across different environments.

9. Authentication Settings: It includes JWT (JSON Web Token) configurations for different types of authentication (access, refresh, admin, password reset).

10. Email Service Configuration: It provides settings for an email service, likely used for sending notifications or password reset emails.

This configuration file plays a crucial role in maintaining a flexible, secure, and easily manageable backend application by centralizing all configuration data in one place.
