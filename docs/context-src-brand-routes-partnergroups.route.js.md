This code file defines the routes for partner group-related operations in an Express.js application. Its main purpose is to set up the API endpoints for managing partner groups, likely for a brand management system. Here are the key functionalities:

1. It sets up various HTTP routes (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) for partner group operations.
2. It implements authentication middleware (auth) to ensure only authorized users (specifically those with the 'branduser' role) can access these routes.
3. It uses validation middleware (validates) to ensure incoming data meets specified criteria for creating partner groups.
4. It maps each route to a specific controller function in the partnerGroupsController, which handles the business logic for each operation.

The routes include:
- Getting a list of partners
- Creating a new partner group
- Updating an existing partner group
- Deleting a partner group
- Retrieving details of a specific partner group
- Getting a list of partners within a specific group
- Retrieving all partner groups

This router module provides a structured way to handle partner group-related HTTP requests, ensuring proper authentication, validation, and routing to the appropriate controller functions.
