This code defines a Mongoose schema and model for user activity tracking in a MongoDB database. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and key functionality:

1. Purpose:
   - To create a data structure for storing and managing user activity information.
   - To track user sessions and their timing details.

2. Key Functionality:
   - Defines an "activitySchema" using Mongoose, specifying the structure of activity documents.
   - Includes fields for user identification, session timing, and timestamp management.
   - Creates a Mongoose model named "Activity" based on the defined schema.

3. Schema Fields:
   - user_id: Stores the MongoDB ObjectId of the associated user.
   - last_session: Tracks the timestamp of the user's last session.
   - session_start: Records the start time of the current session.
   - session_end: Records the end time of the current session.
   - createdAt and updatedAt: Automatically managed timestamps for document creation and updates.

4. Timestamp Handling:
   - Uses a custom timestamp function to store time in Unix timestamp format (seconds since epoch).

5. Model Export:
   - Exports the "Activity" model for use in other parts of the application, allowing for CRUD operations on activity documents.

This module is crucial for applications that need to monitor and analyze user activity patterns, session durations, and engagement metrics.
