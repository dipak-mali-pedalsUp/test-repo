This code file sets up file upload functionality using AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) for an application. Its main purposes and key functionalities are:

1. Configuration:
   - Sets up AWS SDK with provided credentials and region.
   - Configures a specific S3 bucket named "impression-bucket" for file storage.

2. File Upload Options:
   - Defines three different upload configurations using multer and multer-s3:
     a. uploadDirect: Uses memory storage for temporary file handling.
     b. upload: Configures single file upload to S3.
     c. uploadMultiple: Allows multiple file uploads (up to 5) to S3.

3. S3 Upload Settings:
   - Sets ACL to "public-read" for uploaded files.
   - Uses automatic content type detection.
   - Generates unique filenames using timestamps and original filenames.

4. Exports:
   - Makes the upload configurations available for use in other parts of the application.

This code provides a reusable setup for handling file uploads to AWS S3, which can be easily integrated into route handlers or other parts of the backend application to manage file uploads from clients.
