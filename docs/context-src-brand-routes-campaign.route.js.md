This code file defines the routing for campaign-related operations in an Express.js application. Its main purpose is to set up various API endpoints for managing campaigns, likely for a brand management system. Key functionalities include:

1. Setting up Express router for campaign routes.
2. Importing necessary middlewares, validators, and controllers.
3. Defining routes for different campaign operations, such as:
   - Creating a new campaign
   - Saving a campaign as draft
   - Retrieving campaigns
   - Getting and adding categories
   - Retrieving campaign details
   - Pausing/unpausing campaigns
   - Changing campaign mode
   - Editing campaigns
   - Deleting campaigns

4. Implementing authentication middleware (auth) to ensure only authorized users (specifically brandusers) can access these routes.
5. Using validation middleware (validates) to ensure incoming data meets specified criteria for certain operations.

The code structures the API endpoints in a RESTful manner, using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different operations. It also demonstrates separation of concerns by delegating the actual logic to a separate controller (campaignController).
