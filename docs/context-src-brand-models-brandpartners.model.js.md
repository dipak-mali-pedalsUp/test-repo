This code defines a Mongoose schema and model for managing relationships between brands and partners in a system. The key functionality includes:

1. Schema Definition: 
   - Creates a schema called `brandpartnersSchema` with various fields to track the relationship between a brand and a partner.

2. Relationship Tracking:
   - Uses `partner_id` and `brand_id` to link to specific partners and brands.
   - Includes fields like `is_blacklisted` and `is_whitelist_requested` to manage partner status.

3. Request Management:
   - `partner_request_status` tracks the status of partnership requests.
   - `request_approved_by` stores who approved a request.

4. Soft Delete:
   - `is_deleted` flag allows for soft deletion of records.

5. Timestamps:
   - Automatically adds `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields, storing Unix timestamps.

6. Model Creation:
   - Creates a Mongoose model named "brandpartners" using the defined schema.

The purpose of this code is to provide a structured way to store and manage relationships between brands and partners, including tracking request statuses, blacklisting, and approval processes. This model can be used in various parts of the application to handle brand-partner interactions and maintain their relationship data.
