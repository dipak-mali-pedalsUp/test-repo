This code file defines a set of routes for a brand dashboard in an Express.js application. The main purpose of this file is to set up API endpoints for various dashboard-related functionalities. Key aspects of this code include:

1. It imports necessary modules, including Express for routing and authentication middleware.

2. It defines several GET routes, each corresponding to a specific dashboard feature such as analytics, top creators, top-selling products, top campaigns, top posts, and various charts (revenue, links, spend, views, and clicks).

3. All routes are protected by authentication middleware, ensuring that only authenticated brand users can access these endpoints.

4. Each route is associated with a specific controller function from the dashboardController, which likely contains the business logic for fetching and processing the required data.

5. The routes are organized to provide a comprehensive set of data points for a brand's dashboard, allowing brand users to access various performance metrics and analytics.

6. The use of role-based access control (roles.branduser) ensures that only users with the appropriate permissions can access these dashboard features.

Overall, this file serves as a central routing mechanism for the brand dashboard, connecting incoming requests to the appropriate controller functions while ensuring proper authentication and authorization.
