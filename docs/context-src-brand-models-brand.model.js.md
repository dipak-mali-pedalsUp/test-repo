This code defines a Mongoose schema for a "Brand" model in a MongoDB database. The purpose of this model is to structure and store information about brands within an application, likely for an influencer marketing or e-commerce platform. Key functionalities include:

1. Defining the structure of a brand document with various fields such as brand name, website, icon, banner image, and objective.

2. Tracking privacy and deletion status of brands with boolean flags.

3. Managing attribution days and integration status for tracking purposes.

4. Storing commission-related information, including default commission rate and ratios for creator and impression commissions.

5. Utilizing timestamps for creation and update times, stored as Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch).

6. Providing default values for most fields to ensure consistency in the database.

7. Creating a Mongoose model named "Brand" based on this schema, which can be used to interact with the brand collection in the MongoDB database.

This model serves as a foundation for brand-related operations in the application, allowing for consistent data structure and easy database interactions for brand management.
