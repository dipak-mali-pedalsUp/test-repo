This code file implements a cron job to periodically update the Twitch access token. Here's a summary of its key functionality:

1. Purpose: To automatically refresh and store the Twitch access token in the database at regular intervals.

2. Key functionality:
   - Uses node-cron to schedule a task that runs every minute.
   - Generates a new Twitch access token using the `generateAccessToken` function.
   - Calculates the expiration time for the new token.
   - Checks if a Twitch token entry already exists in the database.
   - If an entry exists, it updates the token, expiration time, and generation time.
   - If no entry exists, it creates a new entry with the token information.
   - Logs success or error messages using a custom logger.

3. The code ensures that the application always has an up-to-date Twitch access token available for API requests, improving reliability and preventing token expiration issues.

4. Error handling is implemented to catch and log any issues that occur during the token update process.

This cron job is an important part of maintaining the application's integration with Twitch's API by ensuring that a valid access token is always available.
